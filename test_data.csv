  I bought this for use mainly for work tasks when working from home.  It went great for a few months once I adjusted to the OS.  But I've now had it for just over a year and a half.  And the device itself has started to decline, hardware wise.First the battery went. Not really little by little, but after about 4 or 5 months, over the course of a couple weeks, the battery went from working for a solid 8 hours (at that point I was bringing it to my remote office a couple days a week) to suddenly needing a charge in under an hour.Tried to have it fixed, was told user error I had messed up the battery by charging it wrong or something.  Oh well, I don't use it much on the go anyway.Then the speakers. When I unplugged the charger, the sound would go out. Weird, looked it up online, was a known issue. Closed it, reopened without headphone, worked fine.  Then it started happening with just unplugging the headphones. Then one day I unplugged the charger and BAM a giant crackle and the sound is gone. Unplug the headphones, still nothing. Restart the device--nothing. After 3 days I get it looked at.  Head phones now work, speakers are blown. No known fix, not under warranty by a month. Still have an issue where the sound will go out sometimes, and I have to stop everything and restart the entire device. And I can only use headphones, which is beyond annoying.And now, it got worse.  Once or twice I've had it not turn on when I open it. Give it time, try again and it comes on.  Look online, next time reset the device by hitting refresh and power.  Ok whatever.Today, it wouldn't turn on. Lights are on, device makes noise, but no screen.  Tried everything recommended online, nothing.  After 12 hours, it suddenly works with a restart. Great, shows it didn't shut down right, not an issue.  Ten minutes later I close the lid to move rooms.  Open it again, black screen. Lights on, nothing showing.I'm done, I think._x000D_

  Though ChromeOS can take some getting used to, this is an excellent purchase if you only use your laptop for easy things like online browsing, documents, etc. Chromebooks now have access to the Android app store, which makes the possibilities even more expansive. I use mine to browse the internet, watch videos, record audio, and edit pictures. Too heavy to hold as a tablet, but I use the ""tent"" feature often when just watching videos. Though it's too heavy to use one-handed, this is a relatively light laptop that doesn't give me grief when I carry it in my backpack._x000D_

  I was so over the moon with this product from the moment it arrived but then a week to the day after I received, the track pad stopped working and now, after much troubleshooting over the phone, I have to send it in for repair.This does NOT bode well for this product and is beyond disappointing for something brand new.Yes this product is cheaper than Apple products of similar capabilities but it doesn't mean it's cheap. I paid over $300 for this and that's not nothing. Their customer service is lousy, ALL customer service is lousy these days to be honest-all hospitality and human contact has been lost.Total letdown._x000D_

  According to my account I purchased this chromebook 2 years and 9 months ago. I have nothing but good things to say. It is fast, great picture quality, runs all my apps perfectly, has good sound, etc. But the biggest shock to me is that after all this time it still works just as efficiently as the day I got it. It literally runs like brand new. I use it regularly as a computer and a tablet as well as sometimes as a makeshift tv for netflix when we are at hotels or when I visit my parents overnight. Seriously one of the best purchases I've ever made._x000D_

  My son's 5th grade class requires a chromebook or laptop, so we got him this. He's been using it daily for 5 months. The ""R"" key fell off a month or so in, we sent it back, they fixed it and returned it. No problems. It's been great. He loves it, it's easy to use, the touchscreen is great, as is the webcam/mic for online classes.  The only problem now is that he stepped on it and cracked the screen. But it lasted 5 months! Will try to replace the screen...if not, I'd buy this again. It's great for him._x000D_

  1 Nov. 2019  *The hinge (really the entire chromebook in general) feels less sturdy than the r11. be aware of that  *Apple wire earbuds do not work on my or my girlfriend’ (r11) chromebook and so i ended up getting a cheap $5 pair that was also 3.5mm and it did not work either. I ended up getting those cheap bluetooth earbuds that look like a noodle and it works fine. I just thinks it’s unnecessary and don’t know why my other 3.5mm earbuds won’t fit into the 3.5mm jackport...  *I have two bluetooth earbuds that don’t have a wire connecting them and they will NOT connect at the same time. The connection drops from both of them over and over and sounds laggy. You might just have to get cheap bluetooth earbuds that look like a noodle tooOverall, I am still enjoying the r13, despite some setbacks28 Oct. 2019I just received my chromebook today! It came in on time and looks new and fresh. The trackpad is smooth, tablet is not as smooth. I plan to use this more as a laptop, but I enjoy the tent feature so I bought this version of a chromebook. The hinge seems sturdy so far. It's exactly what I expected. I knew that this machine would not be able to download programs like photoshop or vegas, but instead just be a browser in the form of a laptop. It's light weight and easy to carry around. Both the keyboard and the laptop in general is very quiet. My first impressions of the chromebook is good.I will update later on._x000D_

  Love this! Great quality. Good size screen. Love that it flips and that it is touchscreen. People should only buy Macs if they need to use more intense programs or software. Chromebooks do everything the average computer user needs and I love Google Drive, Docs, everything!_x000D_

  It's a beautiful screen, and it has a very decent keyboard. It's thin and light. AND IT'S RATHER PAINFULLY UNDER-POWERED. Sometimes the lag between typing and having the words appear in a field is deeply frustrating. The battery life is strong, easily 8 hours and probably more. It charges fast. The hinge is good.The Mediatek processor is terrible. There's no two ways about it. I currently own 3 chromebooks, and this Acer machine is slower than both of the other two, even though they're more than 2 years old.I use the device all the time, as it's great for browsing with a small number of tabs open or watching Amazon Prime or Netflix._x000D_

  Absolutely adore this machine. My desktop died and so I ran a second monitor off this guy and was able to install my coding software on the linux virtual box. Still waiting for everyone else to notice how amazing chromebooks are so that they get more native apps, but especially with the linux side you can run a lot of full desktop software on these._x000D_

  Based on my friend's review of the similar 11"" model, I looked into the Acer R13 Chromebook. I wanted something that I could unambiguously lock down tight during travel. Chrome OS is perfect for that.This computer has a touch screen, I learned to love that on a Zenbook.Initially my brand new Chromebook would not power up. I determined that the provided USB-C power supply had a badly manufactured USB-C connector. Too much plastic prevented the connector from being inserted far enough to make contact. Junk by design. I used my best pair of wire cutters to remove the excess plastic, allowing proper insertion, and it works now. I love hardware hacking brand new computers.For a computer that retails under $400 you get quite a lot. The Full HD (1920x1080) IPS display is brilliant and sharp.That is the most critical component of a laptop and where my first Chromebook, a cheapo Asus model, failed utterly. This display is not sensitive to viewing angle at all and fonts are crisp and sharp.The touchpad gives very pleasant tactile feedback, the chiclet keyboard is OK too.  One oddity is that the single USB-C connector is on the left edge while the charging indicator LED is on the right edge.Some newer Chromebooks, including this one, can now use the Play Store to install and run Android apps.The lid folds back all the way allowing you to have a 13""tablet, and since the screen is natively 16:9 it's a perfect setup for watching video content.  What would it cost to buy a 13"" tablet sold as a 13"" tablet? More than $400 I reckon.Like any brand new computer there was a critical update dance to be enjoyed right away, but this one brought the access to Android apps via the Play store. This Chromebook has a low power ARM CPU which should help make more Android apps compatible.Is it a 13"" tablet with keyboard and touchpad? Or is it a 13"" laptop with a web browser for an operating system? Yes to both.The Acer R13 Chromebook boots up very quickly, almost instantly.  You can laugh at 95% of the malware-embedded web pages out there because Chrome OS is difficult to exploit.I'm giving it a geek rating of 4 stars.  It would have been 5 if the power supply had not needed repairs right out of the box._x000D_

  I did a lot of reasearch before chosing a Chromebook, and I am so happy with my decision.  I LOVE this Chromebook and would recommend it 100% without hesitation.  It is light, extremely fast, very long batter life, silent as a mouse, never even gets warm, and love the full conversion from a laptop to a tablet.  Big beautiful full HD touchscreen.  If you love Google, you will love this Chromebook!  Only improvement could be a backlit keyboard, other than that, FANTASTIC and worth every penny!_x000D_

  Battery drains about 10-15% a day while turned off and zero use. Not in sleep mode with the lid just closed, but powered off. I have a Lenovo chromebook that started giving me the same exact problem at the same time. This leads me to believe that the problem is cause by a ChromeOS update.No help from chromebook forums. I've powerwashed and uninstalled all third party apps and battery still drains. I realize now that chromebooks are trash._x000D_

  For anyone who likes Android, Chrome, and Linux, this is an outstanding laptop!The ChromeOS beta channel now supports Google Play store, so most Android apps run well.Ubuntu Linux runs perfectly using crouton, even the 64-bit ARM distribution, making it an excellent development pllatform for both Linux and Android applications.Build quality is great, screen is bright and readable at any angle.With support for microSD, USB-C and USB 3.0 Type-A, and up to 64G of eMMC, storage isn't an issue.Add that it's fanless with great battery life of 8-12 hours and you just can't beat it._x000D_

  Love hate relationship actually. There is a ease in simplicity of using it but I am also frustrated as I can't locate certain keys like delete and at times a function occurs when I am simple moving my hand from one place to another.  I am utilizing the touch screen, the touch pad and even a mouse and still a bit frustrated.  Hopefully in time I can master that.  Otherwise it is fun._x000D_

  I have been using a Chromebook and a Windows notebook for several years. Over time I have found myself using the Windows notebook less and less and the Chromebook more and more. I may go months without turning on my Windows notebook. I purchased this device when the power port on the older one stopped working. It is very fast for my needs and I find the ability to flip the screen backward and use it as a tablet to be very convenient. It is much heavier and larger than a tablet. When I need a tablet, I do not consider this a good option._x000D_

  I've bought three of these now.  First one bounced along so after a year I bought two more for my other 2 kids entering HS.  The second two went 6 months and then the touch screen was toast.  On both computers in the same week .  Suggests an error that was known in advance.  Kids have been able to use the computer so we're powering on.  However the hinge on the first computer purchased  stoped working and won't close (kinda the basis of the laptop) I'm looking at other options.  Sucks as I'd hoped this investment would last the HS career.  2.5 years the max this puppy will work I guess._x000D_

  Great screen, great battery, fast enough to do almost everything without lag. Struggles a little in some game apps. Haven't tried Linux on it. Overall it's outlasted 2 amazon tablets and a galaxy s2 tablet. So after a few years of ownership, I've been very pleased with the price I paid. I was shopping for a new Chromebook the other day and can't say they make anything that can compete in this price range even today._x000D_

  This is a fantastic device for home or light work needs. It feels durable, has most of the adequate port and technologies needed for daily use and connectivity. It's battery life is one of it's best features. It easily goes for 8-12 hours of active time and can remain on standby for days. The only consideration to note is that this shouldn't be viewed as a replacement for a standard productivity device for work. It lacks the robust documentation/presentation features and many of the apps aren't yet designed to run offline._x000D_

  Had this for a while and I won't be buying another one. From day one, the power cord did not fit in tight enough to the charging port causing it to fall out often. This means having to hold it in place constantly. As for the software, meh. Google still has a ways to go to make a solid O.S. lots of weird bugs and freezes. System chugs when watching 720/60 video on YouTube. Overall, it's serviceable but knowing what I know now, I would have not purchased a Chromebook._x000D_

  For the most part, I really like this computer. It's a good price and the screen is just right for actually working with the computer on my lap, or at a desk/table. I love the touchscreen option. There's plenty of storage and it's very fast. The only thing I really don't like about it is that it's difficult to open. The magnets keep it closed which is nice, but it definitely takes 2 hands to open it which is annoying. Other than that, it meets all my expectations._x000D_

  I usually don't review items, but felt I should review this Chromebook since I can't contact Acer anymore without sending the item back. My wife has a Samsung Chromebook, it is awesome. This Chromebook, not so much. Most things work fine, speed is comparable, haven't had many issues. My problem is the touch screen. I sometimes touch an area of the screen 4 or 5 times, mostly when there is a dropdown menu, and it keeps registering something 1 or 2 choices away. Only in the Netflix app, if I want to pause a video I have to sometimes touch the screen, 4, 5, up to 10 times to get the pause button to come up. In my Xfinity app, the video sucks. There is some kind of glitch that causes the video to pop in and out of hd to something much worse than sd, very pixely. I know it is the Chromebook because I get sick of it and watch on my old Lenovo tablet and it is crystal clear. Anyway, seems there are quite a few glitchy things that I have issues with that my wife doesn't on hers, can't think of any other reason than that this is an Acer. Spend the extra money on a Samsung._x000D_

  Very quick Chromebook, I love the all aluminum body, solid hinge not flimsy when you switch to a tablet.

  Great flexibility, and super fast.  This is my first tablet, and I am glad that I chose the convertible.  I do NOT like the onscreen keyboard that it comes with.  I also am not a fan of the track pad, so I purchased a wireless trac ball mouse.  When I am in bed @ night leaning against my headboard, I don't want to have to be bothered with moving my mouse hand all around.  The trac ball works fine for that.  The resolution is awesome, and the battery life is ok.  I haven't ever run the battery down all the way, so I can't really tell you how long it will last.  I need to find an adapter that I can get to charge it from my courtesy outlets in my car.  A bit spendy...but, it does everything that I want it to do.  I use my Samsung hotspot feature via Verizon and away I go for great streaming._x000D_

  First thanks Amazon for lousy packing... delivery with no cushion packing and a piece of paper. Next the USB port plug was way to tight, touch pad barely worked, and my 64Gb external card would not read...I sent back to Acer repair after having for one day to see if they can fix my lemon laptop. Very disappointed on Amazon packing and poor manufacturing quality.  Will update post return from Acer on repair.OCT 8th 2018, Disaster unit took a trip to Texas and they did not fix the SD Card read issue...the repair center will not replace the unit and SD micro card still does not work. The 8Gb and 32Gb cards work fine. I also used an adapter card into USB port and 64Gb card worked fine. This really stinks and now they want me to send the unit back to Texas again. What a waste of time. I also noted other people having the same issue!!!!  I give up and sending back to Amazon for a refund.This is a very cool computer but I need the offline memory for things I cannot send to the cloud.  I think the Acer folks know they have a problem since the technical support told me only a 32GB card will work and then the repair center said should be able to handle higher capacity. My Samsung 64Gb card formatted and worked on all my other products except this one. In addition, I used a USB adapter to test out the memory card and worked fine with this unit. As noted, the unit would not recognize nor format this size of memory card.I will wait it out for another generation of products to hit the market before I replace my second Chromebook that is hanging in there._x000D_

  It only took a day for me to be impressed with the functionality of this chromebook. I have never previously owned a chromebook but I knew I needed a light and long lasting device with a decent screen. What I got was exactly that with the added benefit of being able to android apps ( enabled developer mode). I didnt really plan on using this feature much but I have come to really enjoy it. Being able to lay in bed with it propping itself up while playing games like hearthstone (actually runs pretty well) is amazing. I am really happy with this purchase and others are equally impressed by it also.I would say that there are some features/mechanics that take some getting used to. I was expecting to have a right click button, instead you use two fingers which wasn't readily apparent (had to google). If you take some time and learn everything you can do it on it, it quickly becomes a very useful little device.Things I bought it for:-VNC control into desktops and other computers-Webclient manager for Plex and Sonar ( in bed use mainly ) and Freenas-Light google sheets and word use ( lags a little when first opening large sheets files, non issue once open (Unless there are a lot of sheet calculations))Bonus uses I was not expecting:-Native android apps to actually work well-Built in ok google, and tablet mode voice recognitionin fact I wrote this whole review with voice recognition and it came out pretty well only needing some minor correctionsIf anything changes ill update this review below this line._x000D_

  Hey guys I'm gonna leave a nice detailed review here and I hope it really helps people . First off very nice screen for HD 1080 P also very very bright which is great . You have dual band Wi-Fi so 2.4 and 5 GHz . Keyboard is very very nice and trackpad is very good especially for a Chromebook or any laptop. It's very customizable the touchpad that is . It is very fast and speedy apps load very quickly . With the newest updates you now have Google play store so you can now install apks and almost all Google play store apps on top of that you can also resize each window and have multiple apps open. you can have it situated like a regular laptop , you can also completely flip it around and it becomes a tablet and it's very responsive . The sound is very decent nothing that's gonna blow your mind but I would say about average with headphones extremely loud Without distortion. Of course you have Bluetooth you can cast you can do almost anything with this . Honestly This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I'm a tech person and it's very hard for me to be very impressed but for $280 I bought it used and it came in mint condition you would never know it was ever used . If you would ask me is it worth the $350 yes it is. Battery life is amazing , you have a mic you have WebCam I mean this thing has everything they thought of everything and everything works just great. One thing to note you do know the cameras gonna be very low-grade just like on the most any budget laptop or Chromebook but suffice to just Skype if you want to.It's  made of plastic a very good plastic doesn't feel too cheap. For those who are even more experienced and want to run Linux, you can now run Linux on it now.You're gonna see many reviews of many different chrome books but take it for me if you buy this for 280 or 350 you will be very happy they mount the brightness the screen has is incredible.When you look at chrome books make sure it can ring the Google Play Store.Also make sure you will enjoy the keyboard and trackpad...that's probably one of the most important factors.It also has a full USB port,FULL HDMI port, and a Micro SD card (many use SD and that will make the card bugle from the side, so make sure it's  Micro SD.Charges pretty fast also, not lightning quick but very nicely.Cannot say enough about the battery..literally will last for hours.If you want to side load app files you can easily turn on developer mode for those few Android apps that say ""Not compatible"" well side loading fixes those few apps that wouldn't work in the play store for me it was FIos TV..side load and works amazing ;)This chromebook is worth every dime.Don't buy a cheap laptop or a cheap 10 inch tablet you can get everything with this and VERY decent running.Enjoy!!!_x000D_

  I purchased this to display sheet music which means using it in portrait mode.  The power switch is on one short side and the micro-SD on the opposite side.  The power switch and the micro-SD card both protrude out about 1/64"" from the tablet body but that's enough to accidentally push either one when I set it on its end.  If I set it on one end, it powers off.  If I set it on the other end, it pops out the memory chip!  It wouldn't be a problem if they were on the same end!So my not-so-perfect fix is small silicon bumpers I got off Amazon.  They work but can easily slide around or be knocked off.  I just reapplied them after cleaning the surface with alcohol to see if they will stick better.  If not, I'll have to put a couple of dabs of silicon adhesive on each end.I can deal with the power accidentally going off but I would be REALLY upset if I lost my memory chip and all my sheet music.  The micro-SD card should be recessed a little, not sticking out.  It should be somewhat difficult to put in and take out so accidents don't happen.  I just now accidentally popped it out when I picked up the tablet.  I wonder if I can grind off the end of the SD card.  I can't imagine there are any traces within 1/64"" from the edge.  I'll try that on an old SD card.I still give it 4 stars because it's a nice tablet and the full HD screen is nice and bright._x000D_

  A few months after my wife had purchased an R 13 we were so happy with it that I purchased another for my own use. Approximately 18 months later my wife began noticing that he charging cable appeared loose in the port and she had to jiggle it to get it to connect well enough to charge the device. It is important to note that her chromebook literally just sits on her desk plugged in and isn't being moved around or used for travel at all. I began to notice the same issue with mine a few months later. I do travel with my chromebook and the issue has since gotten to the point where I cannot charge it at all. Hers will still charge but she has to hold the cable in place to maintain the connection. The Acer forum revealed many other users who have experienced he same issue. Both of our chromebooks are out of warranty at this point and mine is little better than a paperweight. I would caution anyone to avoid purchasing this item without some kind of extended warranty. As it is a year of operation for a device like this is disappointing and Acer should be ashamed for not covering this defect._x000D_

  Shockingly good? I was expecting poor performance but this thing hardly hiccups even when I have 20 tabs open. Battery life is killer, seriously the best battery life of any touchscreen mobile electronic product I've ever owned, not to mention the quick charge goes super fast. The keyboard is wonderful-- it feels amazing under my fingers so if I have to type something long I ditch my desktop and jump on this. The track-pad is pretty good too. Screen is as bright as it needs to be, unless you're planning on sunbathing while you use this thing.If I could change one thing it would definitely be the charging port. It's weird that they messed this up so bad. It starts fast charging like normal when you plug in a charger but the slightest bump will disrupt the charge. It's painful to charge this thing while using it on your lap because every time you make a small move you have to reinsert the charging cable. I think the port is just a hair to big, and the included charging cord is just a hair to small. It stays in much better when I use my phone USB-C charging cable, though it's still not as tight as it is when I charge my phone. It was incredibly annoying at first, but the good battery life makes up for it since I just charge it an hour or two on a stable surface while I'm not using it and it goes for hours of video watching and document writing with no cord._x000D_

  Using it to write this review. Honestly, for the price I can't imagine a better deal. I have stopped using my 4 year old macbook pro in favor of this computer. Do your homework on chromebooks 1st because it won't do everything your mac does, but it does everything I care about fine, and in a smaller package for less money and a great battery life_x000D_

  I'm shocked at the software issues specific to this Acer R13. I've bought 4 Acer R11's in the last few years, and they were flawless. A year ago, I purchased this Acer R13, as an upgrade in screen size and onboard storage capacity, and after a few months I noticed some problems that definitely weren't present on the prior, R11's.  YES, I do have the latest Google Chrome OS Version 81.0.4044.141 (Official Build) (32-bit) when I write this.  I'm not an expert, but I suspect there's something wrong in the ""intermediate"" software (or firmware), not the Chrome OS.#1: SD card reader does not recognize SD cards >64 GB. At first, I thought the culprit was my 128 GB card, but after verifying that the 128 GB SD card is recognized on my R11's SD card reader AND the 128 GB card IS recognized by the R13's USB slot (when I insert the SD card into a USB adapter), I know for sure it's the R13's SD card reader at fault. The R13's SD card reader does recognize my 64 GB SD card.#2: Screen freeze which is only fixable by manually shutting down and restarting with the power button. This has happened approximately once per month in the past year. It NEVER happened on any of my R11's in the several years that I used the R11's.#3: The taskbar at the bottom of the screen randomly disappears and will not re-appear unless I logout and back in. This didn't start happening until a couple of months ago, and now it happens almost everyday. Less often, maybe once per week lately, the top title bar does the same thing._x000D_

  I had the Acer14 Chromebook which only lasted about a year and a half and now I am on track for the same longevity with this one. The hinges on the Acer 14 weakened to the point where the monitor would flop forwards and backwards constantly, and then essentially broke causing green and pink horizontal lines all over the screen. It was unusable so I trashed it and went for the Acer 13 Touchpad; the screen and screen are great, and has good battery life (now in decline but that is to be expected). Now I am having major issues with the touch pad and space bar after only 1.5 years and I'm ready to toss this one in the garbage can too. The space bar is shot and only works 50% of time; removed it, used compressed air but I still have to constantly go back and add spaces as it onlyworks half the time I hit it. It doesn't work anywhere but in the dead center, and even then doesn't always work. Now the touchpad is a hot mess - I have to click 5,6 times to open links or new tabs, it just doesn't respond. As I try to click into this and continue typing, the cursor is jumping all throughout the text without me even trying. It's also horribly inaccurate - I try to click a button or link and end up clicking something adjacent instead. Now it's opening double and triple tabs constantly to boot. I tried a powerwash and ensured all firmware is up to date but it's just plain oldcheap, faulty hardware. My next Chromebook absolutely won't be an Acer!!! Do not recommend!!_x000D_

  Before getting this, I had a Toshiba Windows 10 machine that was heavy, had a short battery life, was falling apart, and was becoming slower with each day--all of which made it hard to get stuff done. As a college student, I needed a quick, affordable solution for doing schoolwork on the go.Enter the Acer R13 Chromebook. It's smaller and much lighter than my laptop, making it a lot more portable. It starts up quickly and is super-fast, allowing me to get straight to homework without having to go through long loading and annoying Windows updates. Unlike my laptop, it doesn't make any noise. The touchscreen is useful, especially when making notes in OneNote that involve a lot of drawing (like math and chemistry). Performance-wise, I'm able to open multiple tabs in Google Chrome without any slowdown (though an ad-filled page will make things a bit laggy).Most importantly, the battery life is phenomenal. I often get 9-10 hours with average use, and find that I only need to charge it once a day or once every two days. I can use it anywhere I want on campus (providing there's wifi) without having to search the room for the nearest outlet.The downsides:-If your school's wifi is poor, the Chromebook will be pretty useless since there isn't much you can do offline.-You can't install full-fledged computer programs (like Adobe Photoshop) or any PC gaming titles. (Really, you can't install anything that's not an Android app.)-Office products: the Android app versions are good for basic stuff, and so far they meet all of my basic needs (especially Word). However, if you need certain features that are only available in full Office products, then you will be out of luck here. I still need full Word/Excel/PowerPoint, so I use the Office apps on the Chromebook to ""get started"" and add more crucial detail on my laptop later on.-No ""delete"" key. (I find this weird.)-Dependence on cloud storage (which can be good and bad).If you need something with the portability of a tablet but some of the functionality of a laptop, this Chromebook is perfect for you. Overall, this Chromebook meets my basic needs as a college student (portability, web browsing, typing papers, doing online homework), but will not replace the full functionality of a laptop. I use it as a compliment to (but not a replacement of) my laptop._x000D_

  I admit I'm a newbie to chromebooks but having said that, I'm totally impressed. My laptop died and I really didn't want to spend another $800 or more for a new one. I find most of my time on a laptop is browsing the web, reading news,  researching items and YouTube type stuff. So when I started reading into chromebooks,  they sounded like a perfect fit.I started researching and really decided to buy when I found out this chromebook supports developer mode allowing me to download and use playstore apps and games. Wow, that opens up a whole new world. The fact it has a keyboard and touch screen makes it a tablet and laptop all in one at half the cost or less. That's a ton of bang for the buck. I can also download all the same apps on my phone to my chromebook via playstore. So calendar, Google photos, Evernote, Google Drive and docs, all work together with my phone and chromebook. So convenient, I love it.This has a good screen, love that I can play 4k videos on YouTube. Can play movies and music from prime or Google Drive. You get a lot for the price.For newbies like me; this is not a Windows based computer, don't buy if you want to install and play Windows games and programs or do video editing etc.. Having said that, this does most of what a Windows computer can do via Google docs and playstore.If you want to get playstore you need to go into chrome settings and pick developer mode. Then restart, it's literally a click of a button, nothing technical at all. It is in beta mode and all programs don't work perfectly, but it's definitely 100% worth doing with all you get from playstore.This is one of the best items I have bought for the money, the price has increased since I bought in October however._x000D_

  To start this, if you like androids, you’ll love this. But not being a android fan, I hated this. Not only is it annoying to have most of your apps be mobile apps not desktop apps, but the google play store isn’t the best.The mouse and right click is poorly made. Had to buy a wireless mouse because I couldn’t tolerate it. Then it only has one USB port so if I needed it for anything else, I can’t use my mouse.It’s more of a okay tablet with a keyboard then a actual two in one laptop. Needs more laptop features._x000D_

  After two weeks, I love it. I used Crouton to side load Ubuntu and except for a problem with the switching back and forth not always working, it's been great having both variants of the operating system. As other mentioned there is a bounce of the screen but nothing that has caused enough problems or annoyance. With Google Play Store the value of the Chromebook has greatly increased. Except for Lightroom for photography, this Chromebook has taken the place of my $3,000 laptop._x000D_

  Bought for my wife to replace an aging iPad.  She watches her favorite shows and works on documentation for work using Google's word processing and spreadsheet programs, which are generally compatible with MS Office.  This is one of the few acrobatic devices you can use in just about any position, with the keyboard or as a touchscreen.  I'd replace this in a heartbeat with the same thing._x000D_

  I was in a class when the instructor informed us that her 'only laptop' was accidentally dropped and she was scrambling around to get the information to us.  Yes, I was stressing - I have only a laptop that is a Dell (never again),  old and slow and now I can't turn it off because the button isn't functioning properly. I am so glad I purchased this and can take it with me- unlike my clunker that weighs a ton and a battery life of nothing.  Everything is backed up and a more reliable and FAST backup plan._x000D_

  I really love this chromebook but some things made it a step back.When I first got it, I plugged the charger in the chromebook and tried to turn it on. It wouldn't turn on so I actually had to research on how to turn it on. I finally realized that the charger would not charge unless I fiddle with it and plug in the charger a bit more forceful. Took me a while to finally get the chromebook to start charging and to power it.Overall, everything else other than that is amazing. Pretty responsive, very little lag. Video quality is really good, it really does the job. Battery life is questionable cause I checked the battery percentage and time and it tends to go up and down. I rarely used it at that time but after a while it seems to be stable._x000D_

  I have not had luck with laptops, I have been in college for two years and this is my 4th laptop! I have had 2 HP laptops and they would not let me log in on my school account, the software was in protector mode or whatever and this was just a part of the windows operating system. I had a cheap Acer Chromebook and I loved it (we still have it) but for the program I am going into, it couldn't do what I needed it to. Now I have had this for about a month and I love it! The size is perfect, the screens resolution is amazing and the operating system is exactly what I need as a college student! I highly recommend this laptop for a college students! The only negative thing is it is hard to find protective cases for the 13.3 inch screen! But really that's not a huge deal! It is so easy to use and sleek, the design is elegant and the touchscreen is on point!_x000D_

  This Chromebook is exactly what I was looking for an more. Not only does it have an amazing picture, but the folding is much more sturdy than I thought it would be, and using it as a tablet is easy. I'm planning on using this to watch TV on the patio all summer! The touch screen is great too. This was worth the money. There are several out there in the same price range, but this one had it all.

  I’ve owned or have auditioned more Chromebooks than I can actually remember (along with some high-end Ultrabooks). From the basic Samsung Series 3 to the high-end Pixel LS (my go-to machine). I was looking for a convertible with a larger screen to take the place of my Chromebook Flip, so I thought I’d give the new Acer R13 a shot. There are things that are good and not so good, and there are also a couple items that shoppers need to be aware of before purchasing this device.  4 Stars means ""I like it"" so I rated it 4 stars because of the way I'll primarily use it (not as a tablet).  It arrived on Stable Channel Version 52 and after the update it's now on Stable Version 54.  If you want to run Android apps you can switch to the Developer Channel (55 at this moment), but Developer is unstable and you may have issues.  If Google follows its normal schedule we could see Android apps on Stable in 6 weeks (but don't hold your breath).  If you have any specific questions after reading this review please don't hesitate to ask them in the comments section.  I will be happy to answer as soon as I can.TWO THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU BUY: For a 13” convertible this computer is BIG and HEAVY. It’s practically a 14” laptop with a 13” display. I forgot to add a 13” laptop sleeve when I did my order, but I had an Amazon Basics 14” laptop sleeve sitting around from an Acer Chromebook 14 that I had auditioned a couple months back (which my folks now use). All the other 13” laptops I have owned fit quite nicely into the 13” Amazon sleeves, but those sleeves were too small for this Acer R13 (unless I really stretch the thing and risked scratching the laptop with the zipper). I understand that a convertible needs some bezel beyond the display so you can hold it as a tablet without inadvertently touching things on the screen, but not to the point that a 13” laptop is the size of a 14”.  The width isn't all that bad, but the depth could stand to be about half an inch less. The R13 is also heavy. At over 3 pounds it feels unwieldy when using it as a tablet (especially portrait mode). I can manage my 10” Asus Chromebook Flip for extended sessions in tablet mode, but unless you have the R13 resting against your legs and are holding it in landscape mode it gets uncomfortable pretty quickly. If you’re looking to use this R13 primarily in laptop, tent, or stand/display modes or as a tablet in landscape mode that’s resting on something, then the size and weight shouldn’t be too much of an issue. However, if your intent is to use this mainly as a tablet you definitely need to consider the size and weight.DISPLAY: For a budget 1920x1080 panel the brightness, sharpness, and color are very good and I had no dead pixels. The display is easy to see in a sunlit room and looks good when dimmed in a dark environment. The panel leans towards a warmer color temperature (like the Chromebook 14), which I prefer; and it looks great when streaming video. On my 13” 1080p Chromebooks I like to set the resolution to 1536x864. You lose only a little sharpness, but things are much easier to read. The easiest way to change the resolution on any Chromebook is to hold the “ctrl” and “shift” down while you tap the “+” (zooms in and lowers resolution) or “-“ (zooms out and increases resolution). The resolution will change instantly and you’ll get a notification in the lower right corner. Running in a lower resolution will have NO EFFECT on full screen playback of 1080 video. The lid which houses the display may be metal, but it’s not all that rigid. I recommend caution when opening, closing, or flipping the lid. The touchscreen works well too. Not as responsive as my Pixel, but it already seems better than the one on my Asus Flip. Tapping, scrolling, panning, swiping, and pinch-zooming all work well, but the lid bounces quite a bit when you tap the screen in laptop mode (wobbles back and forth at least 7 times).PERFORMANCE: Don't expect the R13 to scream right off the bat.  It'll be a bit shakey while it updates itself, syncs your account data, and installs your apps/extensions (especially if you already had another Chromebook).  Once you do start browsing it'll also be a bit slow to load pages as you build up your cache.  So far for me, the performance has been pretty good. The R13 is certainly faster than my flip, but obviously slower than my Pixel LS. It does seem to run better than the Acer Chromebook 14 I picked up for my folks, and the Octane score says it should. I streamed off of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and played some 1080p 60fps videos on YouTube; all of which worked well and played smoothly. Facebook loads quickly and scrolls pretty smoothly (not like on the little Flip). Loading pages while streaming music or video didn’t really seem to cause any issues either. I’m not a tab monster so I really didn’t push the machine in that regard, but I will do some testing and report back. My Wi-Fi connection has been solid, but I have not had a chance to run the R13 with any Bluetooth devices.  UPDATE:  I've have had a couple crashes (system crashed and restarted) over the past couple days, Both of which occurred during video playback on YouTube, but at this time I don't see this as a real problem.  I have been an early adopter of several Chromebooks, and this behavior sometimes occurs with new models (and new to Chrome OS CPUs) and is usually resolved after a couple Chrome OS updates.  I had lots of glitches with my Asus Flip when I first got it, but that machine runs great now.  If this becomes a problem I'll be sure to update my review.  UPDATE 2:  After a third crash I did a simple ""Hard Reset"" to the R13.  A hard reset disconnects the battery from all systems that never really shut down (like the charging system or the orientation sensor) allowing them to reset.  The whole process takes about 6 seconds and no data or settings are lost.  You simply hold the reload/refresh key (circular arrow on top row) and tap the power button.  The machine will shut off and then restart in only a couple seconds.  Since I did the hard reset I have not had any crashes, and I've been using the R13 a lot (knock on wood).TOUCHPAD: The touchpad is pretty smooth, relatively solid, and pleasantly responsive (like most Chromebook pads). It fits well into the base, and my example is well seated against the single click button. That button is located front and center under the pad and is easy enough to click as long as you stay within the front 75% of the pad. Trying to click anywhere near the back of the pad will cause excessive flexing of the base and won’t result in an actual click. I only physically “click” the pad when it’s required. Tap-to-click is enabled by default and the pad responds well to all my 1, 2, and 3 finger inputs. The pad is approximately 4” wide by 2.5” tall. I would have preferred another half an inch in the height, but I’m not complaining.KEYBOARD:  When I first posted this review I was pretty harsh on the keyboard in this R13.  Aftrer banging away on it for a few more days I have deceided to adjust this section.  I’ve never been a fan of the keyboards that Acer puts in their Chromebooks, but the one in this R13 is an improvement over the ones Acer used in the past. I'll admit I’ve been spoiled by some fantastic laptop keyboards, but I would also add that the one in my little Asus Flip feels a bit better.  The keyboard in the R13 is a good size for me, and I’ve used it to type this review and a bunch of other stuff.  It’ll get the job done for casual to medium users, but can get fatiguing during long sessions spent typing. The pressure required is okay, but I’d still like a little crisper break at the end of the keystroke. I would also have preferred a backlit keyboard for my four hundred bucks, but It isn't essential for me as I've been using Chrome OS keyboards for so long that the layout is second nature.  The R13 keyboard should not be considered a deal-breaker at all (unless you plan to pen the next great American novel with it), I just had higher hopes.  UPDATE:  I think part of my complaints regarding this keyboard are due to the fact that there is enough flex in the center of the laptop's body that you often feel a bit of give when a key bottoms out.  If you press, even lightly, between the spacebar and the touchpad the deck will distort.OVERALL BUILD QUALITY: The R13 is a very attractive laptop and the fit and finish on my unit is very good. I appreciate the metal construction for its aesthetics, but I expected this machine to be more solid (especially considering its weight). This machine is no more rigid (possibly less, even) than my son’s Toshiba Chromebook 2 with its plastic body. I have a couple 13” Ultrabooks that are much thinner and lighter than this R13. Yet they feel much more rigid and exhibit little to no chassis flex when held by a front corner. The R13 twists like a pretzel (okay, maybe I'm exaggeratig a little) when you hold it by the front corner and simply resting your hands on the base as you type results in some flexing. It feels very solid when it’s closed or in tablet mode, but like the keyboard, I expected more. I would also re-state that users are cautious when opening, closing, or flipping the lid as it can get pretty bendy as well (which could result in a cracked screen).  UPDATE:  While considering why my R13 was so ""bendy"" I thought about the screws that attach the bottom and deceided to check them out.  The 4 screws that run along the end nearest to the hinge weren't exactly coming out, but they were loose.  I pulled out a small phillips head, broke all the bottom screws loose, set the laptop lid down on a nice flat surface and then snugged up all the screws.  I would say that there is now less chasis flex when I hold it by one of the front corners.  This didn't change the amount of flex in the main deck, nor did I expect it to.BATTERY AND CHARGING:  The R13 uses USB Type C charging and the included power adapter comes in 2 sections and totals 12ft in length with a 1”x 1.5”x 4” brick in the middle. I will comment further on battery life at a later time and once I’ve run through a couple cycles.  At the time of this writing and with the display at about 25% brightness, the battery is at 90%, and I have around 11:45 of power left (Wow!).  UPDATE:  I am very impressed with the battery on the R13.  I basically used it for 2 evenings at home without recharging.  When it was run down to 7% I shut the power off and plugged the computer in (a good technique to use if you want to ""reset"" the battery meter).  I came back in 1-1/2 hours and it was full.  I started surfing at 25% brightness with 2 tabs open in the browser and my mail open in a second window and the meter reported I had 13 hours of battery life.  25% brightness is just fine (and less straining on the eyes) in a room with the TV and a lamp on, so I'm really not making any sort of major sacrafice to save battery power.  I need to pay more attention to the machine next time I recharge it.  And I'd also like to do a 15 minute charge test to see how much on-time that will net me (in the Pixel you can get around 2 hours of battery in 15 minutes of charging).  UPDATE:  I ran the battery down to 8%, shut the machine down and plugged in the charger.  The time to recharge was 1-1/2 hours.  I have 2 tabs open and my Gmail in a separate window, my screen is at 25% brightness and I'm typing this update.  The battery meter reports that I'm at 100% and have 11-1/2 to 12 hours of battery time available (it's jumps around a bit based on my actions).  Obviously this would change were I to brighten the screen or really start surfing around, but still, the battery is impressive considering that the first laptop I ever bought ran for about 45 minutes before you had to plug it in!MISCELANEOUS: All the ports and plugs work well, as do the side mounted power and volume buttons. The speakers sound pretty good and I like the side/bottom firing configuration.  They aren't all that loud, but they do sound good.  The headphone jack has plenty of power and can handle some of my hard to drive headphones.  The included webcam is average at best, and I haven’t had a chance to make a video call yet.  The biggest micro SD card I have is a 64GB and it worked fine.  I'd imagine this could handle a 128GB card, but I don't know about a 256GB.  The R13 connected right up to my cloud printer and I did a quick remote desktop session with a Win 10 PC.  I plugged in my Schiit Bifrost DAC and the R13 recognized it right away.  It worked with a Logitech micro-receiver mouse and also a Logitech USB webcam.  You can plug in your digital camera (nothing too old) and directly upload your pictures to the machine or your cloud drive.  HDMI to my TV worked good as a mirror, extended, and external display.  I also tried it with an external optical drive and had no issues (reads only compatible files... no CD/DVD playback or burning).A HANDY TIP TO SIMPLIFY LOGIN:  With the update to Chrome OS Version 54 you can now use a pin to log into your Chromebook when it wakes from sleep or when you switch users.  With the R13 you can easily tell if you’re in sleep mode by looking for the flashing amber light on the right side of the laptop.  If you actually shut the machine down (as opposed to simply closing the lid) and restart it you will still need to log in with your Google password.  This capability isn’t enabled by default, but it’s easy to set up by using the following steps.  This is especially handy when logging in while not in laptop mode (meaning you're using the on-screen keyboard); especially if you have special characters in your password.• Enable the Quick Unlock flag at chrome://flags/#quick-unlock-pin (type into browser)• Reboot• Next head into the new Material Design settings menu at chrome://md-settings/• From here select the option to Configure Quick Unlock• Select the Quick Unlock setting you’d like to use, configure your PIN, and rebootCONCLUSION (For Now): I think this could have been a much better Chromebook with only a few small tweaks; mainly the size and the weight. I didn’t expect this 13” Chromebook to be the size of a 14” Chromebook. Especially considering that it is meant to be used as a tablet from time to time. I wish Acer would have done a bit more work on the keyboard or at least included a backlight. I also wish this R13 was more solid/rigidly built. There’s just a ton of flex in both the lid, the deck, and the base for a metal body. If you’re looking for an attractive convertible with adequate performance that can be used “occasionally” as a tablet the R13 should be considered. If you want a giant tablet to run Android apps (should be here by the end of the year) you really need to realize how unwieldy this thing can be when using it as a tablet. In this regard I would say that bigger isn’t always better. This will be a good fit for me because I bought it primarily for sitting up in bed and watching video. I expected just a bit more for what the R13 costs, and if you don’t need the 180 degree hinge there are much nicer machines out there for not too much more money (Dell Chromebook 13, HP Chromebook 13 for example).REGARDING THE PHOTOS:  A reader asked if I could compare the display of the R13 to the Toshiba Chromebook 2. I included my Pixel LS display as another reference.  The brightness looks similar in the pictures due to my phone’s camera, but the Toshiba is definitely brighter (probably 340 nits according to Laptopmag) than the R13 and similar to the Pixel (which is also very bright).  The R13 and the Toshiba are warmer where the Pixel is a bit cooler in color temperature.  The R13 and Pixel have a more neutral level of color saturation while the CB2 has a much higher saturation (un-natural, but pleasing to many people).  The temperature and saturation actually showed up pretty well.  This does speak to my wish that Google would include some basic user adjustable color/saturation settings in Chrome OS.  As I stated earlier in my review, I am happy with the color quality and brightness level of R13 even if it isn’t the brightest or most colorful display available in a Chromebook.Picture 1:  Toshiba CB 2 on left:  Acer R13 on rightPicture 2:  Toshiba CB 2 on left:  Pixel LS on rightPicture 3:  Pixel on left:  Acer R13 on right_x000D_

  I am a certifiable Chrome device fan. My fascination with Chrome OS began with an all plastic, low-end Samsung Chromebook in 2012. A long time Windows user and developer, I quickly became enamored with instant on, no fuss no muss computing. Gone were the seemingly endless time wasting updates and nerve wracking scans for malware. Since then, I have added an Acer 270P, Asus Flip C100, and Asus Chromebox to my list of go-to devices. I almost never use our 27 inch iMac with 5K Retina screen and cringe when powering up our Windows PCs.I am developing all new websites using online themes like Divi, so I no longer need my PC only Artisteer or Mac-Centric RapidWeaver programs to create and maintain responsive sites. My workhorse Acer 720P was starting to lose a little battery life, and I longed for a better display. After much research, I opted for the Acer R13.As many have noted, the screen is lovely, the fit and finish of the case, feel and function of keyboard and trackpad are impressive. Pages and files load quickly and WiFi connections are solid with no apparent attenuation from the metal case. So far, battery life seems to meet published quotes of 10 to 11 hours. As with most Chrome laptops, estimated remaining power is frequently recalculated. The R13 takes updates of remaining battery life to a maddening extreme. One minute it may inspire with an estimated 7 hours and the next a depressing 5 hours. It shifts enough to limit it as a useful estimate of remaining run time. My astigmatism forces me to spend an inordinate amount of time adjusting and testing different resolutions and find the 1536x864 setting with a page zoom of 125% yields the best text clarity for me.The R13 is frequently described as heavy. It does have a bit of solid heft to it, but I would not characterize it as heavy. After draining the battery to 3%, charge time to full was approximately 2 hours. Some complain that screen brightness is limited, but from one who often lights a room with the glow from his computer, I find the screen at max to be too bright to use for extended periods. Audio volume is a tad lower than that of my Acer 270P but loud enough to share music and videos with others sitting close. Bluetooth syncs quickly with my LG headset.The R13 is one of the Chromebooks listed by Google in line for Play Store Apps support, but as of this review, the only way to install apps is to switch to the Beta channel. The only app of interest to me is Skype, and I can wait for stable channel support.The Acer R13 is an excellent laptop computer and has become my La-Z-Boy computer of choice. Recommended without hesitation!﻿Update: With almost a week of daily use, the R13 has never disappointed, Battery life is close to 10 ½ hours. Charge time from lows around 3% remaining life to 100% is a bit less than 2 hours. YouTube videos and MP4 files stream without hiccups. As of this update, the Play Store is not available on the stable channel. I switched to beta and downloaded the free release of the Power Director, video editor. I am familiar with the PC desktop program and impressed with features, responsiveness, and ease of use of the Android app. I decided I could wait for the promised stable channel release and reset the R13 to the stable channel. The R13 has become my preferred laptop for entertainment and work. I spend much of my time developing, and maintaining websites using the Divi theme and Divi Developer plugin. I am literally using the R13 while comfortably seated in a Lay-Z-Boy recliner where the fan-less cool case is appreciated.UPDATE 8-30-2017My Acer R13 Chromebook just updated to Version 60.0.3112.112 (Official Build) (32-bit) and enabled Play Store access using the stable channel. Long wait but as I look through the store none of the apps seem particularly appealing.  8-30-2017_x000D_

  Good for basic tasks, but the durability is suspect.  I've been using this for about 5 months, and the back of the screen frame is separating from the body (see pictures).  I'm pretty careful with this device, putting it in my backpack for my daily commute and removing it when I get to the office.Good:1.  Bootup time is crazy fast (maybe 5 seconds).2.  Overall inexpensive option for checking email and basic web browsing.3.  Screen is clear and keyboard is pretty good.4.  Battery lasts for 12+ hours in my normal use.Bad:1.  The hinge appears to flex the back of the screen, which is causing mine to separate.2.  Chrome OS takes quite a bit of getting used to (compared to Windows or Mac OS).3.  Apps from the Play Store are a little glitchy._x000D_

  Dec 2017:This is a very sexy device, but with most really sexy things there are drawbacks.This unit charges very fast, battery really lasts a long time - Especially if you keep your screen brightness low.  Looks great!!!So far everything I have downloaded from the Google Store has worked just fine.  Nice touch to a Chromebook.However - a Ferrari is a very sexy car, but no one uses it as their daily driver.They put the power button on the side of the system in a way that you can't help but turn off/on the system by accident several times a day.  Every time you move / adjust the system, you just can't help but hit the power button.  The Chromebook 14 has the power button up on the keyboard.  Never hit it by accident.When you put the system in your backpack, you have to choose, Power Button Up OR Power button Down.  If power button Down - it will constantly be trying to turn on in your pack.  If you choose Power Button UP - The SD card is down, and when you pull it out of your pack, the SD Card will be missing in your pack (you hope...)  I still can't believe I still keep finding the SD card around and haven't lost it so far.  It's only been a couple of weeks, the card is going to come up missing sooner or later.  Same thing when you have it in tablet mode reading a book.  You have to choose - Power button down, or SD Card down.  Do you prefer accidentally turning off the device, or accidentally ejecting your SD card and playing hide and seek.  They need a way that the card doesn't come out by accident.The charger plugs in on the opposite side as the power button.  Again, if you are trying to catch up on your reading, or cramming for the next test while charging the unit, you will be forever turning the device back on when you accidentally turn it off.Lack of USB 3 Ports - There is only one standard USB Port.  you can run your mouse OR access your Flash Drive.  You can NOT back up your flash drive to another flash drive or USB Hard Drive.  I got a ""Anker Premium USB-C Mini-Dock"" 69.99 on Amazon.  Very nice touch Anker.  Gives you more USB Ports and adds an Ethernet port which is great for when you get a new Router, and need to be able to plug into it to configure it.  Very cool device.Dirty Screen - One drawback to touch screen is that you get your grubby little fingers all over the screen.  You better always have that cleaning cloth close by your side for every little smudge.  When trying to scroll down web pages, those phantom smudges register as a second finger and the text is constantly jumping larger and smaller.  If you are dyslexic, or ADHD, this will absolutely obliterate your comprehension of what you are trying to read.  We all have smart phones, we are used to having to cleaning our screens, but this just seems a little too sensitive to that sort of thing.  I just ordered a screen protector - will see if that tones it down a bit.All in all...What this system does well - It Does Really WellWhat this system doesn't do well - I Doesn't Do Well.Updated 9 Feb 2018After Owning it for 90 days, the power plug on the side of the Chromebook became loose and it stopped charging.  Called Acer Support.  They are sending me a shipping label to send the system in._x000D_

  I've always been a fan of Windows but increasingly I've become disillusioned with Windows lack of privacy, vulnerability and incessant security theater surrounding it. Each week brings another stack of exploits for Windows in a never ending floor, week after week. These days the threats have become so advanced that simply visiting a website can cause kernal level exploits under Windows. To be honest, the only real reason a general consumer should run Windows is if you are a gamer - you have little choice in gaming. Everyone else should really be migrating to ChromeOS as soon as possible.I ordered 3 of these to migrate the household notebooks to ChromeOS after doing extensive research. Part of the reason is ChromeOS has matured into a fine operating system these days and comes native with Googleplay greatly expanding your menu of choices. Second, for security ChromeOS is second to none, it's a secured operating system based on the Gentoo Linux Distro and latest Kernals. It's virtually impenetrable to malware of every type. I'm happy to report that even the most technical/geek type person will now find ChromeOS to be a fully fleshed out OS in most cases.As to this device in particular, it was my choice because of a variety of reasons. The primary reason is I will not run Intel chips due to the Meltdown and Spectre exploits and known Intel Backdoors. This uses a heterogeneous ARM chip and by design is much more secure than Intel. This notebook also met ALL of my conditions.Overall it's a fantastic device and perhaps the best Sub-$500 Chromebook in the world. It's not the lightest being full Aluminum but probably the coolest running since Aluminum is superior in heat-bleed. It's also probably one of the more durable units out there. Out of the 3 I purchased I am returning one because the touchpad doesn't feel like it was seated correctly from the factory. I probably wouldn't have noticed it if I didn't have 2 other ones to compare it to. But since it is 'obviously' different than the other 2 I am going to assume it's a defect and get it replaced while under the return policy.Screen wise this has a GREAT screen. Colors are 'warm' like Samsung OLED's (even warmer) but I often prefer warm screens over the cold white ones you find elsewhere. It's easier on the eyes and colors look amazing. I recommend using this on full bright, anything less and I feel the contrast becomes slightly washed out. Not bad, but it looks fabulous on max-brightness.For older folks like me (50+, LOL) you will find 1920x1080 to make everything TINY. Since this is the native resolution you will want to run at 1920x1080. So the solution is to go into the accessibility settings and 'boost' the size of text and objects while retaining the 1920x1080. ChromeOS does it right in this respect and you have MANY options for improving the way the screen is displayed - which is fantastic.GREAT Chromebook, if not the best Sub-$500+ unit in the world._x000D_

  This is my first Chrome Book and I am very satisfied so far. I did a lot of research before buying this one and am glad i chose the Acer R 13 . It's light weight but has a quality feel . The screen is similar to my smart phone in resolution and colors are very vibrant . It's also easy to set-up , maybe 10 minutes before I had it running and at first I was worried about the lack of the Google play store app but with the first update for the machine it installed it . So don't be worried about it at all . I didn't have to do anything at all for the app to install .Not being paid for this review as sometimes others are ._x000D_

  I am surprised by how much I love this machine. I wanted this screen size and the ability to run Android Apps, and I took a shot at this during a ""deal of the day."" It is now my primary machine away from my desk, leaving my Windows laptop in the dust for ease, battery life, speed to wake, connectivity, etc... Extra useful if you have a Google Phone, it recogizes my unlocked Pixel and allows me to by pass the password entry if the phone is in range and unlocked. Also can activate data sharing via my Pixel without me setting up tethering. Really great on the go. Love the touch screen in laptop mode more than I thought (I assumed I would only use that in tablet mode) and have actually really used tent mode when showing things to clients and I didn't think I would ever do that. Great battery life, great fast charge, nice keyboard - I'm really impressed!_x000D_

  This is my 4th Chromebook and it replaces the Acer Chromebook 14 which was very good also.  The Google Play store is working on the Dev Channel and this puts it over the top.  I love reading comic books and this is the perfect size in tablet mode.  The battery gets me through my workday and the Type-C USB allows fast charging if I ever have a heavy use day.  I prefer the ARM chips for the better battery and silent fan-less operation.  If you need a high octane score maybe a i5 or i7 will serve you better and with fast charging maybe 12 hour batteries aren't necessary.Chrome Remote Desktop works great, so combine a Chromebook with a Desktop PC and sky's the limit._x000D_

  I work as a system administrator and my computer is my life.  I need to have access to a charged laptop that is ready to use quickly.  This Chromebook is the first device that truly meets those requirements.  The battery life is phenomenal and I regularly get over 11 hours of use (yes use, not standby).  The touchscreen is outstanding too and the overall build quality inspires confidence and radiates elegance.  Four stars due to a few minor annoyances like mediocre speaker quality (but hey, it's a laptop).  Extended review below.Extended:Overall this is an outstanding Chromebook and works very well for my everyday use.  I never worry about a charge and even when using it for work there are times when I spend an entire week without having to charge it.  The size is perfect and the weight is just right.  Build materials are great quality and no plastic is to be found.  The touchscreen works well and feels absolutely great.  The screen hinges do not become loose and the overall quality is astounding.Anyone purchasing this is likely to already know about Chromebooks and some of their ""caveats"" but I'd like to provide some details on that end: Chromebooks are not Windows or Mac computers.  You will not be able to run desktop programs.  You also do not need an internet connection for this device to work.  Many applications work just fine offline and things like taking notes, editing spreadsheets and editing Word documents are all very easy and pleasant with Google's product suite (Google Docs, Google Sheets, etc).If you are already accustomed to the Google ecosystem and use Gmail, Docs, etc. on a regular basis than this will work very well for you.  From a more technical standpoint, you can run Linux via ""Crouton"" just fine with this Chromebook.  I was able to run several different Crouton ""distros"" including Ubuntu and Debian with XFCE.  Performance was just fine and I was able to switch back and forth between the Linux instance (Crouton) and the native ChromeOS.  I will mention that some of the newer Chromebooks (processor dependent) are getting ""native"" Linux app support in ChromeOS however this device is not on the list it seems.  To me this was no big deal because anyone who needs to use Linux apps should have no problem using Crouton.I personally ran Visual Studio for coding and had absolutely no issues.  I was also able to run an RDP client and a VNC client for remote desktops when needed for my job.  Performance is not perfect when using Crouton but quite good and you still retain the outstanding battery life.  My battery life was not adversely affected which is remarkable because I am not aware of any other laptop that gets 11+ hours of active usage running Linux or another full featured OS.The keyboard is comfortable, trackpad works well and the speakers are okay but not  great.  The screen quality is outstanding, incredibly bright and has great response times.  Cold boot times as well as ""wake up"" times are measured in single digit seconds and the laptop often feels like it's ready to use by the time you finish opening the lid.Charging is done via a single USB-C port.  This works well and the charger is fully reversible (as it's USB-C).  USB 3.0 ports are available for media transfer at great speeds which is a big plus.  Hard drive space is limited but this is intended to be a ""cloud"" device so that is not a big deal to me.  In addition, fast USB ports make expanding storage very easy.  In addition to a very performant WiFi chip this Chromebook also offers Bluetooth connectivity.I would highly recommend this Chromebook, it's a near perfect laptop for me as an ""on the go"" systems administrator and is indeed a perfect Chromebook by my standards._x000D_

  We purchased this for my son in April 2018.  Worked fine at first, easy setup, no issues. Around Dec. it started to power down while in use.  It didn't matter if it was plugged in and the battery wasn't dying, it just shuts off.  Spent too much money on this and everywhere I took it won't touch it and just gave me a lecture on why you shouldn't buy a Chromebook.  Everyone says it will cost more to fix than it would to buy a new one.  I figured by paying a little more for one, I would be getting a better product, apparently not. Just contacted the seller to see if the 1-year warranty will stand for this as I have proof of purchase through Amazon, but we'll see if they'll do anything for us._x000D_

  I might have received a lemon. After a few minutes of it being powered on, the screen would respond to phantom touches: pinch to zoom; rando taps… no way to stop it besides closing it and reopening to reset the digitizer, but my unit would do it again and again. Completely unusable._x000D_

  On the surface this seems like a great device, but it’s not. I tried to give it a chance and assumed a lot of the frustration was due to learning a new system but no. So all the apps are equivalent to an android phone so word, excel and other office apps are missing a ton of functions, the keyboard doesn’t seem to recognize the spacebar which was all more annoying than anything. The issue is any device you try to plug in seems to have a problem and neither google or acer could offer a solution. The breaking point was when I got an extra micro SD card for additonal storage. After 2.5 hours of multiple deserts, hard power cycles, chats with IT and much frustration, I gave up trying to get the chrome book to recognize the card and opted to return the device. Never getting another chrome book again_x000D_

  This is a decent Chromebook, but for the price,I would expect more out of it. Start up is quick and seamless and the browser runs and loads at a very good speed. It is responsive and meets all the needs, if you are using it for basic tasks and we browsing. No issues streaming videos or loading anything. However, when you flip it around and try to use it as a tablet, it is awful. The touchscreen response is terrible. Half the time it doesn't work, or it reads your touch a bit to the left, or right. It is basically impossible to type on the touchscreen keyboard. Most of the time the space bar does not read and when typing a word, it only picks up about half the letters you try to type. No point in getting a convertible chromebook if the tablet part can't function. Will be returning this one._x000D_

  Even though many have posted glowing reviews, this laptop is extremely slow due to poor optimization by google. Browsing HTML heavy websites bring this chromebook to its knees, and seemingly lightweight tasks are a struggle with its slow speed. The core of the problem is the mediatek chip inside of this laptop. Great CPU with a horribly underpowered GPU that is almost 5 years old at this point. Also, the touchscreen is faulty, with tons of phantom touches being registered at random, making the touchscreen completely useless. This is a hardware bug and since amazon support doesn't reach this far I am at a loss of what to do._x000D_

  I bought this to replace my ipad mini since it no longer received updates. I went with the convertible to use as a tablet but honestly i never used this as a tablet. It isn't as convenient as a traditional tablet, however works great for basic apps or tasks as a laptop. Also, when flipped as a tablet, it is a little odd to have the exposed keyboard on the opposite side.The battery life is pretty great on this and is very speedy. Buffering full quality streams or video is a little choppy at first but overall great at bridging the gap between wanting a laptop or tablet. I wouldn't use this as my primary computer but great at being a mobile complement to my PC._x000D_

  One of the most noticeable features of the the Acer R13 is the build quality. It is a very nice looking piece of hardware. Fortunately, it isn't an empty suit, and what's inside is just as impressive as its looks. Over the last year or so, 2 in 1's or convertibles have been gaining in popularity and there are more and more options to choose from. The Acer R13 separates itself from the pack by combining a great touch screen, a very comfortable keyboard and superb battery life to make using it a very pleasurable experience. The processor, which is a MediaTek MT8173C Core Pilot Quad-Core ARM, is largely responsible for its great battery life, but it also doesn't disappoint with more than ample processing power. I'll often have more than ten tabs open simultaneously, and have rarely noticed a slowdown. Another great feature of the processor is that because it's an ARM, there's no fan, which means it's 100% noise free. I've had a few Chromebooks, varying in price and performance points, and this is without question the best. It's also the most expensive, so my expectations were satisfied.The timing of this feature rich Chromebook couldn't be better. As Google has been rolling out the Android App store to select chromebooks, the Acer R13 was specifically designed with this in mind. The touch screen makes using Android apps on its 13"" screen seem natural. So far, the screen has been accurate and responsive. It does take a little getting use to handling such a large device while using the laptop in tablet mode. Acer built in an accelerometer  so the laptop functions exactly like a tablet or smartphone, re-positioning and reoreinting itself in real time.I would have liked a back-lit keyboard but fortunately it wasn't a must have. I have noticed a few magazine reviews that mentioned it was a bit heavy, but I really haven't noticed. Generally, Chromebooks are much lighter than Windows or Macs, and the R13 is about the weight you'd expect. It also offers a USB C charging port, hdmi input, usb 3 port, and a micro sd card slot. Another nice feature it has is a volume control button on the side which comes in handy while it's in tablet mode.If you're looking for a mid-ranged price Chromebook, there are more than a few options; however, with all things being considered -price, build quality, features, and appearance- the Acer R13 just might offer the best deal for the dollar._x000D_

  i like it. it was between this and the asus c302. I went with the acer because it was cheaper and it ticked off most of the boxes that i needed/wanted. however if i could do it over i would spend the extra money on the asus for the faster processor. the keyboard and trackpad and that kinda stuff dont really matter to me. they work and theyre fine. but the mediatek ARM processor isnt good at handling photos from my SD card. very slow to read the files and very slow to upload if at all. considering that was one of the main things i wanted this chromebook to do, its pretty disappointing, but i should have done a little more research first so i cant fault the machine too much. i like everything else about it. i got it for $357 with no tax. the asus c302 was $485 plus tax at the time. so the savings were significant, but like i said, the processor is worht the extra money. i will probably keep this chromebook until the next wave of chromebooks roll out in 2018 and then assess the situation to see if an upgrade is worth it._x000D_

  Best Prime Day Deal for 2017. It's nice when you find the chromebook you actually wanted $100 off! The 32GB version was $300.First, this is one nice Chromebook. If you understand the Google world of Google Docs, Play Store, and how to run most applications on the web, this Chromebook is going to work for you. If you need to run Microsoft Office, understand that Google Docs can help you replace those but you might need to either subscribe to Office 365 or use Chrome Remote Desktop to edit those on your PC.I'm finding this to be a great laptop to actually do both work and play. The R13 features a very nice screen that is plenty bright and clear. The screen can fold over to be a touchscreen tablet but I find I really like using it more as a laptop. With an extra mouse connected, the R13 allows you to actually do more than with the touchscreen. The touchscreen is very responsive but I just don't seem to want to use as much. As for the performance, I am not disappointed. The R13 Mediatek MT8173C and 4GB RAM are quite quick. Boot Up times are less than 2 secs. The only wait I've encountered is the initial Chrome OS updates needed to install the Play Store. The R13 currently is running on the Beta channel and Chrome OS Version 60.0.3112.50. You will need to change the channel on the 1st user who becomes the owner before you can have the Play Store. I haven't really seen any issues with the Play Store Android apps other than a few games that need to be updates to resize\maximize the windows. Though I haven't really benchmarked the performance, apps load very fast. Also, though some reviews think the speakers are not very strong, I thought the speakers sound plenty loud, maybe a bit hollow but not uncommon for any laptop.Other Chromebooks are getting a lot of looks due the inclusion of a pen and 4:3 Display, the Acer R13 is a great deal at $300 (vs $400) for most users looking to have a Chromebook convertible._x000D_

I did get the accidental damage uplift warranty from square trade because lets face it she is a young adult and there is always the possibly to drop or have spills around it.  She is very happy with the laptop.  Fits easily in her backpack, is light weight, durable frame and she likes that it can fold into tablet form to watch movies or read.

  I really like this chromebook.I bought this because I was leaving my job and would be unable to use the laptop they gave me for work - HP Notebook which I LOOOOVED.For the price, this Chromebook has been great! I read the reviews and learned that there is no right-click option, however, it is touch screen, so if you touch and hold whatever it is you are trying to right click, it gives you all of the normal options.There is no ""CAPS"" lock button, which is certainly not the end of the world, but sort of surprised me.Keyboard is not backlit, for some people that's a big deal, for me, I was indifferent, but thought I'd note it.It took a little bit of getting used to an apps based laptop...but I knew exactly what I was buying, so that's my own deal. :)Other than those minor mentions above, if you need a laptop mainly for email, surfing, and you're familiar with Google Drive - this is awesome!_x000D_

  One day after the date I could return this Chromebook it started acting up. I did a Powerwash and went back to factory settings, didn't help. Did a full wipe and recovery and it still won't let us access the Google Play Store and without that you can't download apps. Very disappointed._x000D_

  I am a heavy user of resource hungry programs and my work laptop is fully loaded to get me through the day.  However when I get home my home laptop was also fully powered despite the fact that all I do is surf the web and watch Amazon Prime and Netflix.  It was overkill.  16GB Ram to stream Amazon Prime is a bit of overkill.  So is the 4K screen.  What I really wanted was a lightweight machine, with an HD screen that would work all day on battery alone.  Sounds like the perfect niche for a Chromebook.  After reading up on the different options out there I decided on the Acer Chromebook R13 based on  reviews and specs and pricing.  The machine accomplishes what is was intended to do.  Nice clear picture, streaming video, and Chrome OS which is great.  The operating system integrates very nicely with my android phone so my calendar and email stays up to date on the Chromebook, my android phone and my windows 10 machine.  Most importantly. Best of all, I am no longer tethered to a power outlet.  The Acer R13 specs list it has a 12 hour battery and I routinely get between 11-12 hours between charges.  Thinking of getting a Chromebook, you would do well to pick up the Acer Chromebook R12_x000D_

  Don't recommend this Chromebook, returned only 1.5 weeks after purchase. It's slow, really slow. Octane 2.0 put it in the 9,000 range. Checked an ASUS 302 at the local big box, it clocked in at 20k, the base level Pixelbook was 35k. Video was OK, though a little jumpy at times. Playing slither.io or paper.io was abysmal. Extremely jumpy and unplayable. The microphone was also broken on delivery. And to top it off, the track pad is crunchy (some kind of dual mode touch thing). Do yourself a favor, spend the extra money on the ASUS, or go big with the Pixelbook._x000D_

  I've had this laptop for about 4 months, and I've really enjoyed it so far. I decided to make the upgrade from an 11"" Acer Chromebook CB3-132 and am so glad I did. It's definitely heavier than the baseline plastic Acers (in the $100-200 range), but if you want a laptop that feels solid, this is the one you want. I was genuinely impressed at how high quality the laptop feels to the touch -- it reminds me of a Macbook, honestly -- and while some of the other reviews imply that it is too heavy, it's about the same weight as a normal Macbook (not an Air). If you're constantly traveling and trying to travel light, then yes, maybe the 11"" plastic Acers would be more your speed, but I prefer the functionality and quality of this model. The size is the perfect balance in my opinion -- it's nicer than the 11"" for watching videos (and with the convertible screen, it can look like a standalone TV if you put it on a flat surface), and it doesn't have the unwieldy feel of a 15"" laptop.The computer boots fast, and the built in software loads relatively quickly. The ability to send browsing history and tabs to Chrome on your phone from the laptop is very convenient. The battery life is pretty decent. It's not the 12 hours Google boasts; realistically, you can get about 5-6 hours of near constant browsing out of one charge, which is really not that bad. It also holds a charge pretty well when it's not in use; I've left it sit for a few days after a full charge and have come back to 3/4 battery life left. However, if you're using it for streaming video, it'll probably only be about 3-4 hours between charges.The touchscreen is pretty sensitive and accurate, though sometimes it doesn't register when I'm flipping between horizontal and vertical use, so I need to give it a good few flips to get it to the right orientation. The built-in Canvas app is pretty sophisticated for a free, default program, and is good for casual artists, though you'll want to invest in a touchscreen pen to get more accuracy. As an e-reader, the vertical view is aesthetically pleasing to read PDFs and news articles, but the touch keyboard and scroll function can get kind of laggy, and not all webpages are optimized to be viewed in the vertical dimensions.My only recurring issue so far has been the touchpad. It's a touchpad that responds to taps as well as clicks, and sometimes the clicking part gets stuck and essentially gets stuck on a constant right click. It's only happened once or twice, and may be due to debris getting stuck underneath -- I'm not sure, and with laptops, there's no quick, easy way to get inside and check it out. Also, it's easier than I like to accidentally tap/close the browser; I've lost a bunch of tabs all at once by mistake a few times already, which is definitely partially user error, but probably something that could be adjusted in future models.Overall, it's been a great laptop/pad combination for the price. Given that it's a Chromebook and does not allow for use of third party software installs, I would only recommend this laptop for casual to moderate use; anything more RAM intensive or specific than internet browsing and I'd probably go for a beefier Windows or Mac. However, since Google's library of extensions and apps is only growing, it's going to remain a good computer for day to day use by the average person._x000D_

  I bought this hoping for the same great experience as my Acer R11. However there are at least two ways in which the hardware is lesser, making the machine extremely frustrating to use. Most important is the hinge - it is poorly damped. If you set the screen angle, it holds it, but if you tap on the screen, as you will want to do with the touch screen, it takes at least 5 seconds for the vibrations to die down. Compare the R11, which stops in less than a second. Second, the space bar doesn't register presses on the edge, only in the middle. With the larger chassis, my hands naturally rest so I strike the space bar where it doesn't register. Again, my R11 reacts to key presses anywhere on the space bar. Finally, and this might have been just an issue with my particular unit, Google Play Store crashed repeatedly, making it hard to install Android apps on the machine. I returned the R13, and will have to look elsewhere for a larger Chromebook._x000D_

  I loved the Acer R 13 when I first got it, but it has developed problems with the space bar not working.  I have not spilled anything on the keyboard or damaged the laptop in any way. I have read the community forums on this issue, and I have tried doing a hard reset and changing the keyboard settings. Nothingworks (see?).  It has been suggested that this is a hardware issue involvingthe angle atwhich thekeyboard is struck,meaningthatthe spacebar will not work unless you hit it directly down. Whatever thecause, it isimpossibleto getany kind ofproductivity with this laptop because you have totype so slowly and go back to make corrections. Acer needs to fix this!_x000D_

  I bought this Asus  Chromebook on August 25, 2019, because it was highly rated.  It was slow from the beginning.  The keyboard is a piece of junk compared with the 1st generation Samsung Chromebook Plus on which I am writing this review.  I bought the Samsung in 2017 and it is still working great. The Asus has been disappointing not only with the keyboard but I believe it has a short in it.  I can rest my hands on it and it does random crazy things.  I have constantly cussed it.  I planned to keep it for 2 years to get my money's worth out of it and buy another Chromebook to replace it, but here it is in October 2020, barely more than a year since I bought it, and it has quit on me. Rather it locks up after a few minutes. I have tried everything to keep it from doing that but I have been unsuccessful.  After trying for 3 days and using the Samsung in its place, I am tired of trying.  I just ordered a Google Pixel Go to replace it.  My wife will be happy to get the Samsung back.  I am going to miss it. In my search for a replacement for the Asus, I found that several sites say the new Asus model of what I have is the best Chromebook available. I will never buy another Asus computer. My experience with this one has convinced me that Asus does not make anything I would trust._x000D_

  I guess for the low price point it is probably actually ok. But, the laptop runs hot, like way hotter than I expected. Using this on my lap had me sweating just surfing the web ?! The track pad mouse click button takes a firm push to click, way harder to click than I expected. The brightness, even on high, still feels dark, at least to me. I really wish this came with with a back lit keyboard, felt hard seeing the keys with the dull brightness on the screen._x000D_

  I bought this product so that I could take it to class as my Mac is on its last legs and does not transport easily. Let it be known I did not buy this computer expecting it to last forever. In fact, I just need it to last me one year. That being said, I think it is an excellent and simple computer to have. I've had it for less than a month so far, but I have experienced no issues with it running. It is fast, has a fairly good screen, and has phenomenal battery life. The camera is lacking, but I do not find that to be a problem for my use of the computer. The only real issue I have with it is its terrible trackpad, but that is an easily fixable problem by just buying a mouse. I have found that the touchscreen is a nice feature that I do take advantage of, but as other people have said, the size of this computer makes it an awkward tablet. If you plan on using the computer as mainly a laptop with the touchscreen as a convenient feature, then there should be no issue but if you plan to use it primarily as a tablet, you may find it uncomfortable and clunky. Overall, I find this to be a great piece of technology to have for surfing the Internet or taking notes._x000D_

  This computer is great!!! I was scared of picking the wrong computer and hating myself for it but it works wonderfully. It was larger than expected but it wasn’t a problem it was just bigger than other laptops I’ve had before. I can do my homework, watch Netflix, and YouTube (I love Shane Dawson) without any problems. The touch screen works and I use it quite often. The rotating screen is very helpfully if you like watching movies or reading books. The only thing I had a problem with is the sound, since it’s under the laptop it can sound muffled so I recommend you were headphones. When it’s in the tent position it’s sounds fine. But over all of your looking for a great laptop I would recommend this one._x000D_

  I was let down with this chromebook after enough use with it to really be able to give it an honest review. First issue is that it is slow, really slow. I have a 12"" galaxy tablet that is 8 years old and it runs much , much faster . The other issue is the power button location, when you flip it around to use like a tablet the button is right where you would hold it naturally and it blacks the screen out constantly . The only option is to flip it, then rotate it 180 degrees, then wait for the screen to rotate . The brightness of the display is set very dim and every time I go to settings to turn it up it works great, then when I go to use it again its back to default dim. I have done everything I know to correct this, i brighten the screen in settings , i save the setting, and it works until you put it to sleep and when you go to use again its back to default dim. Hopefully I can resolve some of these issues with tech support because it would be great if these problems did not exist. When you lay a brand new chrome book down and grab an 8 year old tablet because it is faster there is something wrong with that. Good luck..._x000D_

  There's a lot to like about this Chromebook !!  I tried the Asus C213 convertible - twice - and ran into wireless issues on both, then decided to spend the extra $$ and try this model - and I'm delighted I did !!  A big, bright, high-res display with great touch response clear to the edges, excellent wireless and Bluetooth performance, decent sound, and a very quick processor - this machine does both notebook and tablet modes exceptionally well - and a 13.3-inch tablet is amazing !!  It is very sleek and sexy compared to many Chromebooks - very nicely finished all-aluminum housing.  Another big plus - it runs Android apps !!The only gripes I have are that it is quite slippery (I just ordered a hard plastic shell to help that) and the lack of ports.  The Acer only has one USB-3.0 and one USB-C while many others have two of each - this isn't a handicap for me, but if you use a USB mouse you'll have to pull it to use a memory stick or other USB device.  This one does have an HDMI port so you can hook up a monitor without having to purchase a USB-C video adapter.Overall - this is a winner - perfect for web surfing, video watching, and general 'Chromebooking'.  Go for it !!_x000D_

  My order came sooner than expected, and I would like to say that so far I like my Acer Chromebook because of the fact that is has HD resolution, I do a lot of steaming so I want to get the beat quality that I can. I also decided to purchase this because now with the whole pandemic situation going on I have kids at home and I need note options to keep them entertained and so with this Chromebook I could search up coloring activities for them and print them out. My oldest daughter is into drawing and I could also look for options to keep her busy. I like the fact that it is a 2 in 1 and that helps me use it in any convenient way depending what I am doing at the moment. I just have a little trouble when searching up things. I selected Google as my main search engine but for some reason when I do any search there is something that pops up and says that chrome cannot open that page. Also if used in tablet mode for long it locks up and you have to restart the Chromebook to get it to the way you want to use it. Overall I have liked it so far, just have to see how it performs in the future_x000D_

  I almost bought the Acer R 13 last December but I held off when I heard the Android operating system with play store will be available by year endThe fit and finish of the product is excellent the promise of having a tablet and a Chromebook in one device is very compellingI purchased the R-13 last week and received it on Saturday. I have spent over 10 hours trying to get the Android Play Store applications up and running only to find out that it doesn't workI called Acer technical support and they told me that I needed to contact Google technical support about the Android appsI called Google and they told me I needed to contact Acer.I called back  Acer, this time to their sales department and I asked about the R 13 - 2 in 1The salesman I spoke with assured me that the R-13 supports Android and the Play Store appsWhen I informed him the Acer support told me otherwise he was shockedI am legally blind and the promise of being able to use the same functionality that I have on my Samsung phone and on my Samsung tablet on a Chromebook / notebook was very compelling and it was the reason I made this purchase.I am posing a question on the questions to vendor about this issue and I want confirmation that Acer will provide at no charge any future patches or upgrades that will resolve this problem. if they don't answer in the affirmative I will return this product. I suggest before you make any decision to purchase the Acer R-13 you see what the response is going to be to my question I posed to themUPDATE 12/15/17This product runs a beta version of Android and you need to switch between chrome os and android betaIMDB and Direct TV presently will not operate on this BETA version.._x000D_

  Overall I love my new chromebook.  I would have rated it higher except for several small issues.  As far as I can tell the operating system will not let me change font size overall except by lowering the screen resolution which defeats the purpose of having a higher screen resolution.  Netflix will not cast to chromecast even though other programs and devices do.  When I put the device down on it's end my SD memory chip is released.  This is because it sticks out some.

The only downsides to this tablet are that the case it comes with isn't very stable in its ""standing"" position, the charging cable was short in length so we replaced it with a longer one, and the charge port on one of them is a little finicky.Otherwise a very good value. Have been used daily for about 2 months. They are able to play minecraft and roblox and educational app games easily without glitching.For one of my children, I purchased one of the silicone bumper cases. The one on Amazon that fits this is called ""Transwon case for Vankyo  Matrixpad s21, Novel TTT 2 in 1 tablets 10 inch, Aoyodkg tablet 10 inch A32, Gowon 10 inch tablet P8, Duoduogo V12,_x000D_

  Do NOT buy these. Made the mistake of buying two and had to immediately return and exchange one for not turning on. My kids have used them maybe 3 times and now neither of them will charge or come on. My kids didn't tell me that they were not working so we are outside of the return window. Don't waste money on this. They are total CRAP._x000D_

  For the money it's perfect! I didn't really expect a lot for l that you get at that price but I'm pleased everything works like it should was using as soon as I got it out of the box and turned on I'm definitely not using as a phone so I can't say anything about that but for a little laptop it's got a little storage it's not the fastest nor the slowest I mainly do puzzles and read that's why I bought it and no problem doing those things I'm happy with the purchase and would purchase again_x000D_

  I was questioning whether this was a good deal or not but it turned out to be a great deal! The tablet is nice and all the extra gadgets work well. I got this mainly to be able to rewrite music and have a larger screen to read off of. It works well for all I need. The mouse will need two Triple A batteries and I would suggest investing in a longer C charger. The tablet doesn't hold a charge for long, so keep the charger close by. Over all I'm very satisfied with this product._x000D_

Believe me when I say their,  Do not waste your money on this device. I bought it so that my son could have his online classes. I only downloaded gmail, google classroom, google meet and zoom. Anything else was already loaded onto the device. However it constantly hangs up, the sound keeps disappearing and the battery dies quickly. The device is so slow I have to constantly restart it so that the apps will open.

It’s very easy comfortable using it to watch movies and listen to music. In another word, it is a small version of computer, But I don’t usually use it for computer function. I watch TV while eating snacks, which is very comfortable. The SIM cards we currently use are smaller than the standard ones, but the SIM card of this product is a standard card, and its battery can be used for 6 hours for watching movies. If you use it, don’t works, it can last for whole day. It is really inexpensive. Really happy to have one around this price._x000D_

  I’m still figuring it out, but am So Pleased with this tablet!!  I should have bought the same tablet without the keyboard and mouse, for I just don’t need them like I thought I would.When I got it, I thought I Needed a SIM card for it to work... Nope, works great with WiFi!Super lightweight, I only use the Pink Case while charging to protect it just in case my kitties or I knock it over.I’ve already changed my Browser from google to Duck Duck Go, a more Secure Browser that doesn’t save or sell all my personal info.I have an iPhone & Cloud Storage at ICloud & Google... already found my 15,000 photos saved on iCloud.There are lots of possible Settings, some for stuff I have no idea about yet...It seems I get about 4 Hours of time on WiFi for my Online College Courses.To take a screenshot, hold Power and Lower Volume at the same time.I can’t figure out how to Name my Albums yet, if ever...Since it’s an Android with a Touchscreen, it’s super easy to use!I bought very Affordable Extra Warranty’s, but I don’t think I can use them during the first year... I’ll work on those tomorrow.I don’t know what Size Memory Card I need to go from 64 to 128 Gb... so I’ll probably have to take it to Office Max to get the right one.The Camera isn’t good at all in low light.I’ll try taking pictures tomorrow in the day, Out of the Case!Comes with about 20 Apps already installed, and I’ve added a couple from Play Store.This is my first Tablet, & I think it will be perfect for my College Courses!Wish I had bought this Much Sooner!I also need to find a Printer & figure out how to Bluetooth or connect them with a cable.I’m Happy so Far!!

I love the screen size of this tablet(10”), it is only a bit smaller than my laptop screen size(13”). It also comes with many different accessories including a keyboard and a mouse, so I don't have to use the touchscreen all the times to type or click. With the keyboard, this tablet feels like a laptop and I'm able to work on my assignments fair easily. Also, I really enjoy watching drama with this tablet, it has long battery life, good audio and sharp picture quality.

  I managed my expectations due to the price. There was no need. It's a good product for the price. There are better made products on the market, but at a much higher price point. The power button could be better made and appears to be the weakest link . They appear to have tried to mitigate heavy handed use of the power button by framing it with foam which makes it look cheap, but it's an acceptable tradeoff if it serves to increase the lifespan of the device. The screen quality, size, and ease of use, along with the other accessories makes this a very good deal. I have other devices for primary use, but Iwanted a 2in1 for travel. I was looking for something with a  slightly larger screen than my phone. This is a decent size but slightly heavier than I would have wanted for a handheld device. After about 30 minutes of use I could feel the weight, not a deal breaker.This device was an excellent choice._x000D_

  I bought this as a homeschool tool for my 9th grader. It is so slow. Some of the apps we wanted to use are not compatible and won't load. The touch screen feels weird. I thought we could watch YouTube videos and use it for Udemy courses. It is just really disappointing. The picture quality is fuzzy. Turns out my Samsung J7 Luna works way better, but a phone is no picnic for all purpose school use. I would not recommend this and I'm disappointed I bought it. The case doesn't fit well, so it partially blocks the camera and makes navigating the touch screen difficult. I made a poor choice. Curses._x000D_

  I was looking for an inexpensive but quality tablet to replace my dad's old/slow Kindle. I was surprised and skeptical when I came across this tablet.  4GB RAM+64GB ROM, Dual SIM 4G, Quad Core, 13MP Dual Camera, 8000mAh, with Keyboard/Mouse/Leather Case/Screen Protector/Touch Screen Pen/LED light, for $119.99, really?? I decided give it a try as my credit card provides return protection anyway.  It did not disappoint me and actually is a no brainer good deal! The 64GB ROM gives my dad sufficient space to store his photos and videos in addition to many apps he requires for his small business and personal entertainment, and the 4GB RAM and Quad Core allow a smooth experience without any delay. Dual SIM 4G and Keyboard/Mouse are especially useful for my dad's small business as he can have toggle between two phone lines on this tablet, and also use it as a small computer. Plus the Leather Case/Screen Protector saved me at least another $20, very considerate! For $100-$150 price range, i compared many different tablets on amazon, and I believe this one's quality-price-ratio is the best so really cannot expect more. :)_x000D_

  I have been using this tablet for four days, and overall I think it will pass. It does a good job. The screen size is large and the audio quality is good, but the battery life may be longer. It seems that the charge will soon be lost.It takes some time to install the applications, and sometimes they may load slowly, but once they are properly opened, they seem to run better than on my other devices. For example, on my phone, Twitter often crashes, but there are no stability issues on this tablet.The game load on this tablet is very good; very fast and responsive, the default screen brightness is just right. Whenever you try to enter something, it may take a while for the touch keyboard to load, and outside of the game, the touch screen does n’t always record where your finger touches on the screen, but overall, it ’s a solid tablet Absolute value for money if you are looking for a budget alternative to the iPad or Google Pixel-especially when your first priority is to use the device to store videos and / or play games._x000D_

  The tablet is nice. Its surprisingly heavy though. The screen is good quality. Operating speed is a little slow. It's basically for reading apps and social media, games, etc. so it will be ok.A lot of what made me choose this item over similar, cheaper, one was the extras that come with it. They are NOT worth it!The cover is very nice. Sturdy, magnetic, looks good. It ends there.The keyboard is very thin and cheap feeling. It weakly connects to the cover by magnets. It feels like it will fall off easily and when it does, it will break!The mouse is also cheap, thin plastic. It did not work at all when I pkugged it into the tablet. I believe that is due to having to use the USB adapter.Why does this come with a light? Why is that a perk? Its a flexible stick light. It would be an excellent book light if your book had a USB port.This tablet doesnt even have a USB port! WHY SEND USB ACCESSORIES?  The mouse and light have USB connectors. You do get a USB to C dongle. So you can have this huge stick coming out the top of your tablet if you want to use the accessories. I wouldnt recommend that though, it will eventually break the port and then you wont even be able to charge your tablet.Bonus! You also get a pair of earbuds! .....There is no headphone jack on this tablet though and no dongle for that.You get a peel and stick screen protector. It fits.You get a stylus/ink pen. Very cheap and the screen doesn't react to it well at all.So what you get here is a decent large, heavy tablet with a pretty nice cover, and a bunch of cheap crap that you probably won't use._x000D_

I have used my last tablet for over a year and a half and there are no marks on the screen.  After only using for four days and using the stylus that came with it I have many marks.  I guess i should have spent more to get a better quality one._x000D_

  I bought this for my daughter to use for learning apps and to play Roblox. It does have beautiful picture and sound. It works great for most programs. However, there have been 2 big problems: 1) It freezes when she attempts to play Roblox. The screen freezes or the she is not even let into any games. 2) I could not register the product using the information that came with the tablet. It never recognized the information. Would I recommend this product? Yeah, I guess, if you are not playing games on it. Not at all if you want it for games._x000D_

  I’ve read so many reviews, gone to so many sites, had so many other tablets in my cart, and am so happy that I chose this tablet. I compared tech specifications between this tablet and all the name brands, but kept coming back to this one. My logic was that if it wasn’t good quality, at least I wasn’t out much. Once I ordered, I was contacted by the seller within the day. Seller told me I would receive it in a week. It was shipped promptly and I got it in 5 days !! Nice packaging inside the normal amazon box. Came with screen protector film on it plus another one of higher durability. I’ve attached a picture of apps that came preinstalled. It was fully charged when I received it. 14 hours of battery I have left, which is more than the tech specs said to expect. Good speed, no problem loading movies and the million pictures and videos I have in my drive. I moved a few large files around to see how quick they would transfer through drive, also pleasantly surprised. I’ve always been an Apple product person, but use google services for work. I might have changed to an Android supporter after this purchase. The customer service offered for this product is outstanding. It has Duraspeed and options for multiple accounts. You can add a SIM card. They had the warranty site bookmarked on the home screen for easy warranty registration which was very thoughtful. When you register your warranty, you are offered a free gift. If you are on the fence, go for it, I’m glad I did._x000D_

OK here is a list of thing i like and don't like about this Tablet.Pros:1)Great Value comes with everything you need , you don't need to buy extra accessories2) screen size is better than Fire Kindle3) Fast processor for Youtube, Youtube Kids and Netflix4) Memory can be expand with a SD Card. come with 64GB5) Clean Android System without any Blot Application6) battery life is good last for at least 7 hours Cons:1) coloration is not saturated2) kind of heavy and thick.3) slow system Firmware update._x000D_

  This tablet is a good value for the money.Positive : Picture quality is good, Plenty of accessories to go along with the tablet including case, screen protector, mouse, earphones and key board. keyboard is great.Negative: Very slow performance. Video sometimes lag and apps load slowly, Connection for the mouse can be faulty and needs to be ""jiggled"" to make a connection. Speakers are poor. Battery life is acceptable but not great.Considering the price, This is still a good deal._x000D_

  Bought this in May.  Loved it but recently it would not hold a charge and now it is dead!  Past the return date but would like a replacement or refund because it has a one year warranty but no place on Amazon to request one.  Any option I try will not allow me to refer to the tablet on question.  Difficult to explain the problems I am having trying to resolve this.  Even Amazon customer service can't address this as I cannot include the original order in a request for a replacement or help on why the tablet is totally dead.  Even tried using a new charger.  Nothing.  So all photos, etc. on the tablet are lost and can't be recovered._x000D_

  I need a 10 inch screen tablet just for reading pdf materials and surfing online, so I didn’t plan to pay a lot on it. While searching for the tablet, I noticed that this tablet has so many nice features, including the latest global Android 9.0 in 2020, high-power 64-bit quad-core processor, 4GB RAM and 64GB/128GB ROM, high-Definition tablets resolution of 1280x800 pixels, which are over my expectation. When I received the product, I like its big screen, which gives me very good experience to read. It is felt like heavier than a tablet, which more like a mini computer. So far I am happy to have this product._x000D_

It was very nice that it came with everything including a case and screen protector. It also had a mouse that came with it along with earphones. Not only those, but the package also had a USB light that was very bright despite it being so small. The battery life can last pretty long! The touch screen is also very easy to control and use! It is very fast and won’t lag that much! I gave my child this tablet for an online class and it worked excellent for them!

  I got this to replace my old GalaxyTab which I was very happy with, but I wanted to see if I could find something I could actually use with a keyboard case while plugged in, or charge with the keyboard case closed. Well, this one definitely fills that bill, which is awesome.It came complete with a case that works properly with all the device's ports and cameras, a very comfortable magnetic Bluetooth keyboard that has BOTH a backspace button AND a delete key (you almost never find both on a keyboard this small) a really cute little USB book light in case you need to type in the dark, a screen protector, and even a wireless mouse, which I didn't need but I'm sure someone in my household will. Best of all it can be charged with the case closed, which you would think would be a design no-brainer, but apparently Samsung didn't think so.It took me a very short time to get it all set up.  The image quality is great; the processor speed is adequate for my needs, and it has more storage than my old Tab had, but everything always has more storage than the last thing you had, these days!I'm happy with everything so far except the design of the stand. The magnetism is kind of weak so it often releases and lets the screen fall over backwards. Seriously I originally took away a star for this reason, but I figured it wasn't worth a whole star. Maybe half a one. I think maybe I'll just attach some Velcro dots to make it sturdier.One other thing to know, if you're considering buying this:  you should go ahead and order a longer charging cable or two right now. It takes a C-type USB charger, the kind you don't have to keep flipping around and around to figure out which way it fits. It fits both ways! So that's great! But the one they send with this device is only about one foot long, so there's no way you're going to be able to use the device while it's plugged in. Not a biggie, considering all the other nice extras that came with it. Just order a couple extra C-type chargers with long cables, because you know out of all the sixteen thousand cables and chargers in your junk drawer right now, not one of them is going to be a C!_x000D_

  When the package came I tried to find instructions there were none that I could find. Nor a warranty to send in. The tablet is fine but the holder won't stand right and the keyboard is useless. It won't pair. I got it to allow me to type once and after that no more. The connections are very short and with no instructions who knows what goes where. It's basically useless except for the tablet itself. I've been buying here a long time and have never seen such poor quality on any product. I would never recommend anyone to buy this bundle. I'm crippled with the internet my only connection to the world and on fixed income. It took me a long time to be able to get this and now it's junk._x000D_

  I was debating on giving this a 3 or 4 star rating. This is the one of those ""budget-friendly"" tablets on the market and I only had this a little over a week. So my experience so far has been what I expected. I absolutely have no problems with the battery life but I really wouldn't recommend having it on and charging at the same time. Picture quality is fairly decent even when you dim down the brightness. The slots where the SD card goes; had a devil of a time trying to open that panel. Felt like I was almost breaking it and I made a little scratch on it. I mainly bought this for sketching and drawing with apps, but being this a ""budget-friendly"" device most apps are not compatible or even available for this device. It's mostly decent for streaming TV apps like Netflix and such. Overall it's a pretty good device considering the price is under $200. So a slight thumbs-up._x000D_

  I see so many people on here who are technology ""experts""  stating how its slow and it sucks and its awful and its build quality is awful.With due respect its build quality is in line with paying $150 bucks for a 10.1"" tablet.  Yes its plastic, yes its screen is only 1900x1200, yes its Media Tek processor is not the top processor available today, yes it ONLY has 2GB of ram.  However your stupid if you feel like this is a letdown, after all most of this information can be found right on the page to purchase the tablet.Here is the deal with this tablet.- I bought it to watch and consume Prime video, Netflix video, (maybe someday put the google store on it for youtube (but even now i can go to youtube on the silk browser and it works perfectly fine)- I play light games, but its able to play what I play without problem.- I do not feel i need to baby this tablet because I only paid 180 bucks for it (64GB not 32) in fact i got two HD8's and this HD10 for me for less than my wife's IPAD.  So if they break it.. im not out 300 bucks-Being a network engineer this is my get away from computers without getting away.  I have zero productivity apps on it (which i like) I have zero communication apps on it (which I like), This tablet for me is a way to get away from life.  I have a phone for talking, and work, and teams, and slack.Dont kid yourself, this is not a high end tablet.  These one star reviews needs to take a better look at themselves and understand  you get what you pay for.  And for me, this absoutley works for what i need it to do.  And i dont feel like crap if i drop it and break it.why not five star.  Speakers are not great, again get what you pay for... which to me is not a big deal... i would of only taken a half a star off for them if I could._x000D_

  Why was my initial review removed?I was about the update my previous 5-star good review with the following only to find my video + photo review was removed!However I discovered that there's around 10% battery drain daily, probably due to the ads on lock screen, even when airplane mode is turned on (wifi off)!I lose almost 70% to 80% charge in about a week!I am aware there's an option to pay to get rid of the ads,but the lock screen ads even consumes so much power on standby just doesn't make any sense to me.I don't mind seeing the ads. Couldn't this be optimized better?I'm now quite upset and decided to return it, for the poorly designed software that drains battery and my deleted review by amazon!_x000D_

  9/22/20 - Tablet died yesterday. Still under warranty.NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems._x000D_

  We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model._x000D_

  I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon._x000D_

  I l logged in to increase my rating but my review was not there.  In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.  Hint to Tech Support:  Recommend this to callers if your hour+ of support does not produce results._x000D_

  Do not buy this!!! 5 of them in 18 months, each one progressively worse. Newest one arrived 10/30. Downloaded my library 4 times in 8 days. The books just vanish off the tablet. Product support useless. Can’t solve the problem can’t understand them. Not an item to be outsourced. I’ve had fire tablets since they first came out, this model s horrible. First one lasted 7 months, next one 5 months, next one 3 months (they sent refurbished without telling me that and it had no warranty), then the next lasted 2 months. Waited 3 weeks for the newest one, it’s lasted 8 DAYS!!!!_x000D_

  I can't recommend this tablet. You will get a much better experience with another brand for the same price, using the amazon apps. For some reason Amazon can't figure out their own software. When you play videos in the prime video app on this device, the bottom bar buttons go away, but the bar itself stays. It is black, so you don't see it, but it causes video to be off center by quite a bit. When you watch videos in a web browser, the bar and buttons stay. The tablet itself feels cheap. It makes cracking sounds with the slightest pressure on the side with the power and volume buttons. The speakers sound really good for a tablet. The USB-C port is a nice addition, but it doesn't allow anything more than charging. It doesn't show external hard drives or allow for a second screen through hdmi. The adaptive brightness is useless. It goes way too dark in low light and not bright enough in well lighted areas. It does allow for adoptable storage with an sd card. Overall it is not bad for $100.00 but should be avoided at the 150.00 price tag. One advantage about these tablets is that the os is very minimal, so most of the advertised storage is available to be used. The tablet does run well unless you are trying to download a movie and use the web browser at the same time. This will likely be the last Fire tablet that I will be purchasing. The bottom bar is a real bugaboo for me, as I am OCD. I would recommend a cheap lenovo or samsung tablet instead of this._x000D_

  I purchased this tablet when Amazon first advertised around Oct 26th or 27th.  If you bought it before Oct 28th, you were supposed to receive Minecraft game (a 6.99 purchase) with it.  It is not on the tablet and there are no instructions how to download it for free.I'd rather give the tablet a 2.5 rating than a three...the tablet has nice features but the sound quality is much poorer on this version than other Kindles I have purchased.  Even with Bose earphones, the sound is muffled. Disappointing._x000D_

  I can compare the ninth generation Kindle Fire 10 HD to the previous generation I also own, fit and finish, which is very good is about the same. So is the weight and size. What is new is the display, CPU running at 2Ghz with 2 Gigabyte of memory. Also debuting is the all new fast USB C interface. Also, there is up to 512 GB SD Card support. Summarizing, the ninth generation Amazon Kindle 10 HD has a lot of new features to offer. I think it is worth it to upgrade from previous versions. As a Kindle device, it is hard to compare it to Android tablets, do to lock of Google Playstore. I correct it just in four steps and in about twenty minutes I was able to install stable version of it on my Kindle. Now i can compare it to Android tablets. Amazon Kindle, with Google Playstore is a potent Android tablet, fast, great 1900x1200 resolution display, plenty of memory.  It is good for fun and business.  Consider that I only paid $99 for mine, I consider it a steal. I highly recommend the ninth generation Amazon Kindle Fire 10 HD_x000D_

  As always after two years of owning a Kindle Fire, it was time again. My latest Kindle has slowed to a crawl, AGAIN, like all the other Kindle Fire models before that. Internet and app response would become ridiculous, and and standard tasks become frustrating and unmanageable.I have come to believe that this is a deliberate strategy to force customers to constantly upgrade their tablet.I warned my wife not to buy  me another Kindle Fire HD for Christmas....I was sick not only of the systematic degradation in performance, but also of the fact that standard apps that I rely on (Der Spiegel, ZDF Mediathek, Wikipedia for some time, to name a couple) are not available in the Amazon App Store - MADNESS. Forget about contacting customer service about this; you will not get more than canned responses such as ""The app ABC will be added in time"". Therefore I always had to rely on tediously sideload the Google Play Store on my Kindle, knowing that this may aggravate things.My wife did not listen, of course, and did get me this new shiny Kindle. Worked nicely the first four weeks, even with Google Play Store installed.Now the kicker...Netflix has deemed all Android devices that are customized (like mine)  no longer compatible with their services as of this week. I rely on Netflix during frequent business travel, and now I am in a bind: Uninstall Google Play and lose access to many vital apps, or lose the use of Netflix.I love Amazon and their integrated services otherwise, but this lack of being at the pulse of the customer in this case is for me the last straw, and I will buy a generic Android tablet that will get me all I need, including the ability to shop Amazon. The Kindle Fire HD is no longer of use to me and I will run over it tomorrow with my car and get me a proper tablet.Goodbye Kindle Fire HD, but we need to see other people._x000D_

  If you need to enlarge the font, the largest font was too small for me. It does not compare to earlier versions of the Kindle fire. I was greatly disappointed because it created too much eyestrain in the largest font setting. Also I like to have the black background which I was not able to figure out on my own and had to call tech-support. But the connection with them was so bad and the customer service representative spoke such broken English I just had to figure that part out on my own. Once I figure that out I realized that the home screen and every other screen used for help was now a bright white which hurt my eyes. I wish I had my old Kindle!_x000D_

  I received my item 31 October (late since I paid for same day shipping).  It worked well for 14 days then went to crap.  It will only work when connected to previously entered password wifi.  No new connections.  This means I can use at the house…. Only.  Like a desktop computer and not a portable tablet.  Once I swipe up and enter my PIN, I have about 2 seconds to enter settings and turn off wifi.  Otherwise the screen blinks and locks in 2-4 seconds.Amazon is shipping a replacement.  If it is no better than this, I will return for a refund and return to the gods of Apple._x000D_

  I just got the new HD fire tablet 10 a few weeks ago. I love it! Everything from the Kindle books, Audio, Alexis audio, music play, games, watching TV and movies and shopping on Amazon. I even like the Fire Tablet’s advertisements and suggestions as to games and books on Amazon. Love it so far!  I have a personal IPAD and Iphone but I use them so much for other things like my work data, GPS, mail and work Phone calls that I really needed a separate device for the fun things in my life like books, music, movies, etc. But this is perfect for my travel life since I travel for a living and I can take this with me and have easy access to all it’s features. I really got it also for listening to the audio books in my car when I am traveling, and I understand you somehow hook that up with Your car bluetooth, but I have not totally figured out how to do that yet so I am hoping I can figure that out soon. The CS lady at Amazon Digital  sent me an email that said to Scroll down at top of Fire Tablet for the options menu, and hit the Sync button to hook up with your Bluetooth to play the Audio in the car which did not really fully explain how to do this,  and I know there is much more detail to hooking up than that  so I am going to investigate further on how to do this.  I think you also have  to set up options with your personal car bluetooth, but I am hoping to figure that out soon. Of course, I have not owned this tablet long enough to rate longevity of it, but I did purchase the 3 year protection plan. I do love it and plan on using it alot. Very happy and impressed so far, but just hoping I can figure out how to listen to the audio books in the car while traveling.Continuation and update tonight: The Audio Book is now working fine in my car without even the Bluetooth. Before when I would try to listen to it - it said it needed a WiFy connection and it could not find the connection, and it would not play the book at all, but now its working fine. (Maybe my book was not downloaded all the way previously or something), but now it is working fine. I listened to the rest of my Audio Book 3 hours home from Atlanta, Ga all the way to Knoxville, TN so that part is good. My other comment about this device is that it has opened up A new exciting, world for me😊Love it- thank U Amazon._x000D_

  This tablet is the best for consumers but not so great for creators. You will be able to read, watch and listen to any content you want without lag for a low price. I got this tablet for only $99 during Black Friday and is well worth the money. I use this table to read and watch content and I could not be happier. The battery lasts for 12hrs of continuous use but realistically this will last you a couple of days without a charge. The screen is very sharp and has great viewing angles. The touch screen is great and highly responsive. I don't use this tablet with speakers but from what I can tell they are nice and loud and will do a good job for anyone that is not an audiophile. My only complaint is the awkward button placement. The volume buttons for some reason are on top of the tablet as opposed to the sides which make it awkward to adjust the volume when using the tablet in landscape mode. This tablet will work best if all your content is purchased through amazon as it neatly has tabs for your music, books, newspapers and videos on your home screen so navigating to your content is a breeze. The google play store is not on the tablet by default so you will have to download it if you want to have access to a greater number of apps. The tablet has 2MP cameras which are great for video calls but horrendous for photography. There is a ton of noise and chromatic aberration when taking pictures even in broad daylight but you are not buying a $100 tablet to create with. However, if you are a photographer, this tablet can handle some light photo editing. You can get an SD card reader, import your photographs into the tablet and open them up with the lightroom app and make basic edits such as cropping, color adjustments and exposure adjustments without any issue. The materials that this tablet is made with seem to be of good quality. The screen is made from scratch-resistant glass and the back is made of some kind of metal alloy. Probably aluminum. For $99 you cannot beat the price for what this tablet can do._x000D_

  Amazon is really going down. I've had lots of battery trouble with all my kindkes. It's the battery that kills them. And while I was able to replace the battery on my first kindle, they made it harder, then impossible. But I got this new kindle so I would be able to restore my bookmarks. The main reason I hate the Silk browser is not being able to import or export bookmarks. I think it's deliberate. But I bought this new 10 inch just to keep my bookmarks. But while it would restore my ebooks, it wouldn't restore my bookmarks, which is a deal breaker for me.Got on the phone trying to get help and talked to someone who barely spoke Engish, who wanted to wipe my old 8.9, the kindle I loved best, instead of this 10 inch. And when I said bookmarks this guy thought I meant ebooks, which did restore. Took a while to half show him what I was talking about. No matter how long I was on, following his directions, no bookmarks.Now I have to send this back, get another kind of tablet and lose all my bookmarks. Really upset about it. But nothing I can do._x000D_

  I will keep it short and simple. Picture and sound are great. does seem faster at times but at others times will be ""laggy"" for no reason when I am not downloading or streaming things. Last the big issue I have is that it keeps.deleting my ebooks, I have had a kindle some the first gen kindle fire and have a nice ebook collection and  it matter how I try it seems to delete and.I download every 8 to 10 hours and so far no real answers from tech support.UPDATE: Okay so a day after this review was posted I was contacted by an Amazon tech person. This time after explaining what was going on and what had already been tried I was sent a new kindle along with instructions on how to return the one I had. The new one came and the old one picked up 3 days later. I downloaded a book and it was still there for 2 days but on the third day it had been deleted, however the kindle had also received an update. Later the same day the same tech person called me and asked about things to which I explained okay till that morning when again books where deleted from the unit. I was told that the update was to fix this issue. (Guess I was not the only one) I am very happy to say that since thank have downloaded my library of over 600 books and no issues with them be deleted now after a week. I also want to add that the issue with the random ""lag"" I had had also stopped._x000D_

  Purchased new Kindle Fire because update on phone no longer allowed me to connect to my hotspot and figured that it was time to update since I had my kindle fire for a few years. I liked the text to speech feature on my table which allows me to listen to my books while I am working. On the new kindle the text to speech reads a page when the cover is closed and then stops. When the cover is open the text to speech may last at the max 20minutes before it stops. Sometimes it will start again once the screen is unlocked. If you value this feature this is extremely annoying. And there is nothing listed on the help manual to fix this problem.  I have not tried the other features on the tablet yet only had it for a couple of days but the main feature that I wanted which is text to speech is the feature I am having the most issues with. I called tech support and was offered $5 for my inconvenience and told that the problem is a known issue and will be fixed in two days. What a crock ... none of it was true..thinking about returning tablet for a refund._x000D_

  I'm not the typical user of a tablet; not a gamer, do all my computing at home on a desktop, don't do social media, don't even have a smartphone.  I've worn out one Kindle E-reader and am hard at work on the second.  I would quite probably have let the tablet scene pass me by, except that I acquired (in 2013) one of the early Fire tablets (HD7) as a premium gift for buying a treadmill from Yowza Fitness.  In a word, I loved it; book and magazine illustrations in Hi-def color was one of its most enjoyable features to me at the time.  It was a little underpowered for video, though it would stream non-HD content fair-to-middling and play just about any downloaded video just fine, HD or not.  So I used and enjoyed it for six years, until I caught wind of the soon-to-be-released Amazon Fire Tablet HD10; there was a lot being said about it, most of it quite positive, enough so that I took the plunge and invested a little less than 250 dollars (tablet, case and heavily-discounted SD memory card).  I can't speak for others, only for myself, but I think I got a heck of a good deal.  The tablet is beautifully made and has a good solid heft; the case is a perfect match for it.  The designers and manufacturer couldn't have improved on it; for looks, I think they came up with a winner.  The colors, graphics, video definition (it also streams HD just fine!) are all top of the line.  It's a bit more complicated than the other one, but still easily learned.  It comes with a fairly large number of Apps preinstalled, and that aren't designed to be removed; I don't mind that too much since there's only a very few that I wouldn't use at all, and I've got LOTS of storage space.  But it is kind of annoying that I can't ""hide"" the icons that fill up the Home screen like I can do on my old desk-top Acer running Win 10.  And while I have nothing against it, I also have no real use for or interest in the Alexa feature; its home-screen icon is four times the size of all the others, and constantly exhorts me to tell Alexa to do something.  But those are minor details and take nothing at all away from my overall positive view of this exceptionally fine example of precision electronics.  And the price! A genuine bargain.  Thanks very much for a fine product and letting me say a few words about it._x000D_

  I own previous generation of Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10.  So, I know how the Fire tablet works with micro sd card.However, this is Fire HD 10 tablet, working with micro sd card is a challenge.  After spending some time and some tests, I have some findings.  This Fire HD 10 tablet requires you to erase (format) your inserted micro sd card before the first use in the tablet.  And the format is only FAT32.  (FAT32 is a problem for some large size Sandisk micro sd card with the File  Reading Error.  I was told that ExFat format is safe for large size micro sd card)Regardless, you can't come prepare with files on your inserted micro sd card.  You have to let this Fire tablet to erase (format) for you.  Once you do that, it gives you two options.  1.  Use the micro sd card as the internal storage of the fire tablet, i.e. apps  2.  Use the micro sd card as portable storage only, i.e. music files or data files)So, you don't have to flexibility to switch sd cards.I tested a 32G, 64G and 128G micro sd card.  I am comfortable to use 128G now.The speed is very good on this device, compare to my other collections of previous generations of Fire tablets.About battery life, I am going to find out._x000D_

  I have had this 2 days.. I have had to download the same books on the 'integrated' Kindle app 4 times since it seems to think I want to remove them every time I switch to a different app.  When switching out of the Book app, it doesn't save the book I am reading (it does save the location on the book I am reading) and I have to re-open it every time.  Kindle app on iPad and phones works much better.I will be returning the device and not asking for a replacement._x000D_

  I thought this was going to be a great tablet until I got it and realized it had two capabilities missing. It has no screen mirror capability even to their own Fire TV stick! There are standards here, it should work with Roku and Chromecast and other TV streaming devices. Then I moved to ""well I will have to go to the wired mode"". But no, the new USB-C connector is used for charging and DOES NOT SUPPORT USB-C TO HDMI TO GET TO YOUR TV. With these 2 capabilities missing the tablet is so crippled it will have to sell for a much lower price.Given this I encourage Amazon to bring back screen mirroring and to bring industry standard capability to the ""USB-C"" connector or label it a charging port and not USB-C. Without these changes I give the tablet a 1 star rating._x000D_

  Great response time. Seems faster than the 2017 version. Nice blue color. Great to be able to use the newer USB C charging . As usual the set up was very easy. I think the screen is crisp and clear. You can't beat this type of a bargain for a functional full-size tablet. It has plenty of stock apps in the Amazon store... But I used the apk's for the latest generation  HD 8 and loaded the Google Play store. Now it is a fully functional all around tablet. Highly recommend..especially for kids and adults for these bargain prices. You won't regret!! Buy Now!_x000D_

  For me, this was a huge step up. I have been using a 2nd Generation Kindle Fire but wanted to be able to use some of the options on the new Fire Tablet.Jumping from 12.6 GB to 64 GB (with an option up to 512 GB) was an important need, giving me the ability to store/use the amount of video I anticipate to be sharing in the coming months. I also had a need for a camera, and the Fire HD 10 has two, front and rear. Additionally, I was excited to see the difference between the speed of my current unit versus the new one. The unit also touted faster charging than before, which would be nice as my 2nd Gen charges at a glacial pace.As far as extras, the 64 GB is a healthy chunk more than the 32 GB, so you can save some dollars if you don’t need the storage. I wanted even more storage, so I added a San-Disk 128 micro SD Memory Card. As stated above, you can have add more memory, but this seemed to be enough for my current needs. If you drop things from time to time or have exploratory children, adding the case is good insurance.Easy to set up, and so far, it’s been everything promised. Five stars._x000D_

  I have read a few reviews in the tech press that lack any detail, leading me to feel the writer has spent little time with this device. I have been using it for just under a month and wish to share my experience. The screen image quality is very good. I have watched several videos on Netflix and Amazon among others and have found the image quality to be excellent.The audio and the projected stereo sound field is at times extraordinary. I, have on more than one occasion looked to the side as a result of the stereo sound field.  One must recognize the speakers are extremely small and keep one's expectations realistic!Battery life is, in my experience awesome. I can watch 2 full-length movies, no problem with juice left to spare. last night, I spent 4 hours with it and it still showed 54% battery remaining. I call that excellent.The device itself is somewhat heavy and very, very slippery so I urge you to purchase a case quickly.Now I come to the Amazon Fire 10HD operating system, a fork of Android.  It handles somewhat different than pure Android but those who have used Android will quickly find the way. The included applications, such as calendar, Silk search, and email are plain and simple but get the job done with a very small learning curve. I suspect Amazon is concerned that some will purchase this fine device with little or no experience with software so keep it simple rules the day.Even, after all this time the Alexa app still suffers a poor user interface. Navigating its convoluted route through Alexa reality is at times confusing at best and I use 3 Chromebooks and 2 PC's so I can most often ""hack it"" around the worst. Most who purchase the device with experience with the Alexa app will suffer only minor pain.Now I fear I have come to the Amazon App Store. The depth and breadth is very small compared to Google's Play Store. Perhaps one fine day Amazon and Google will work something out and Fire tablet sales will explode.A major positive is that  Amazon provides the means of turning off all the Amazon promo stuff so one will not be tortured with pushed adds. Of course, some will like the adds!I must say, without a doubt, at the sale price this tablet is a steal!  If one is an Amazon video user,  along with Netflix buying the Fire HD 10 is an easy and intelligent choiceI wish to add that I have been an Amazon customer for some 11 years and have been satisfied with other Amazon products and Amazon Customer Service is outstanding, period!_x000D_

   What is this flickering on the tablet? See video and picture. Usually happens when I connect and app to Facebook. Great tablet, I love it otherwise, but not sure what’s going on with this flickeringUPDATE#1-Amazon tech support Rachel, called me after seeing my review and tried to help me. She took control of my tablet to view the problem and did trouble shooting. Amazon is going to send me a new tablet as I am the only one with this issue. I really enjoy the new fire 10! It’s faster than the 7th gen, and worth every penny! Thanks Amazon!UPDATE 2: David R from device retrieval is terrible and does not care for Amazon customers. He sent me a label to return the defective device and stated I would get a $30 credit by returning it in 48 hours which I did. But his label was missing when I tried to print so I called Amazon and was told by Lucien B. That David made a mistake and did not send me a proper label and Lucien B from amazon sent me another. I returned the device and because David’s label was not working I will not get a credit as promised. David R would not let me speak to a manager he stated he was in the highest position at Amazon and there was no one higher than him I could speak to. Plus the replacement tablet is also flickering when you connect games to Facebook!FINAL UPDATE: Rachel from tech support has taken care of all the above and sent reassuring communication to me. She has gone above and beyond to take care of my issues and keep an Amazon customer satisfied and happy. She really cares about Amazon customers! Don’t lose this employee Amazon or it would be your loss! Thanks Rachel! Regarding the tablet, the battery lasts super long, I can go 2 days without charging it! Very responsive and I love it more than any of the other fires I own-7 inch, 8 inch, and previous version 10 inch._x000D_

  Arrived yesterday and setup went fine except that the new tablet couldn't restore from my Amazon backup. It's not a huge deal because I use a handful of non-default apps: Netflix, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram & Twitter. Running lean on the prior gen Fire helped to keep things from getting bogged down...I'm happy to say that the new CPU and RAM keeps things very responsive. CCleaner doesn's seem to work reliably but now you can close all open apps at once in the task manager...huge plus. I am happy with it....I ordered a new cover but found my old cover fit. Unfortunately the Alexa Dock doesn't work....it uses micro USB and the new tab is USB C. Ah well, progress...Update: Tablet will lock up on formatting micro sd card as internal storage. Will format as portable storage just fine. Not sure what the issue is. I’m removing a star every time i spend more than 5 minutes trying to do something.Update: Tablet will not connect to bluetooth keyboard. It does not see the keyboard during the pairing process. Also, when viewing YouTube videos via the app from the Amazon app store, the display will go to sleep while viewing the video. Oh Amazon, why do you torture me so?_x000D_

  Got this to use the voice features. Tablet does *not* include the android feature of miracast, only casts to amazon braded devices. Not surprising since its using the FireOS, but disappointing. Also, icon size and fonts are not changeable/customizable in a native fashion. Was able to sideload a normal android app to kinda work, but not 100% successful. In the end, had to return it. Screen is nice and clear, and responsiveness is good, but lack of cast, fonts, and later i discovered USB-C to HDMI made it unsuitable for my needs. I will see if later generations overcome these deliberate shortcomings if enough users like me complain about it. Return process was simple as all of my previous returns have been._x000D_

  I just received my fire hd10 today. I have had it for about 8 hours. So far, I hate it. I have  fire tablet 8 and I think I might send this thing back for a refund!! I love my 8, which is why I ordered the 10. It was supposed to be better. It's NOT! I tried calling every support number for this thing I could find. On one I got an answering machine that said it was the help line for the fire 10, then it said goodbye and hung up. I have been shopping at Amazon since they first started in business and have continued to transfer as much of my business to Amazon as I can throughout the years.  This fire he 10 has me rethinking that practice. There is no help with the fire hd 10! At this point, I would NOT recommend anyone purchasing a fire he 10! In fact I would tell them to stay away from them and to with the older models.  There's not instruction manual with this machine, but I just found one on Amazon (using my 8 tablet) that so can buy for an additional $14.95. Up until today I have loved all my fires and happily recommend them to anyone who would listen. So far, I will not be recommending the 10 to anyone. If anything changes, I will update this teview.but as of now they have a very dissatisfied customer!_x000D_

  I had bought a fire tablet a year or so ago. Due to the poor performance and lack of apps I returned it. Fast forward to now I tried again. I will say the tablet performed well for the price. The problem i had, with my less than a week old tablet, was with the touch screen. There was a spot on the screen that was acting like I was pressing it but nothing was touching the screen. I tried cleaning, removing from case, and every other thing I found online. Nothing worked so I contacted Amazon. After 40 min on chat they are going to send a replacement. 3 days later (when I purchased the original it showed up the next day) I get the replacement only to see that it's a remanufactured tablet. Sorry but that's not acceptable to me. I paid for a new tablet and received one that didnt work so I get sent a remanufactured one instead? No thanks! I'm sending it back even though I think it would have worked for what I wanted it for. Really disappointed in Amazon on this transaction._x000D_

  With so many reviews I doubt anyone needs another one to make a decision on whether or not to purchase this newer Fire 10 tablet, but I'm very satisfy with the purchase and I feel it's fair to share that experience. I own a Fire 10 2017 tablet and other than for the occasional book reading and video watching, I preferred to use my old laptop Instead because the table's slow response, especially at the startup. I hated it going to the internet as well because the pages were slow to open and to response. I have fiber optic internet, so internet speed wasn't the issue.But this newer Fire 10 tablet is so much faster and responsive to every command. Whether is online shopping, watching the news, searching the internet or watching a movie, you can see and feel the difference...like day and night. I ordered the black color tablet and the one issue that may be bothersome, especially for those with bad eyesight, is that the power and volume buttons are not easy to find. Since the screen can rotate, you may find yourself pressing on the wrong side of the tablet, especially at night when your partner is sleeping and then suddenly a video pop-up on your screen and the table's volume happens to be way up. I'm sure you'll get use to it, but really would have like the buttons to be of different color like red, blue or green.I recommend that it you do get one, order the cover as well. It's made specifically for the tablet, it's also of high quality, looks great and can protect your investment. Whether to order the 32 or 64 GB that's your preference; I ordered the 64 GB because I feel is better to have a larger storage and don't need it, than to need it and not having it. I loaded the Google Play store because of the apps I constantly use, so I'm sure the larger storage will come on handy. I also purchased a 128 GB  SD card for videos, photos and file storage.To summorize, this tablet is faster than its predecessor, still at an amazing low price and I'm sure if you get one you'll like as well. I recommend it._x000D_

  Prior to this, I had a Kindle Fire HD 8 (7th Generation). I traded it in once the new HD 10 was available for preorder (receiving 20% off). I am very satisfied with my purchase; however, there are a few things I need to note here.Hardware: The CPU is a MediaTek 8183. It's four Cortex-A73 and four Cortex-A53 cores running at 2.0 GHz. Performance is very solid, so much better than the previous models which were running quad-core only. The 2GB of RAM is a bit of a hurdle (it really should have been 3 GB), but the 32GB of storage with expandable card slot are great for the price. The 10"" 1080p touchscreen is good looking, but it also feels of a better quality and sensitivity than the previous models. The battery is 6300 mAh, and I find myself charging it once every 2-3 days. The USB-C port is the best upgrade Amazon made here.Software: The system is Fire OS 7. When you install apps to view system information, they claim it's a modified version of Android 9.0 Pie. Some of Pie's features are readily noticeable (clock screen on the left, a supported Picture in Picture mode, etc.) but you can also tell it's a very slimmed down experience. For example, there is no apparent multi-window support (though developer options show the option is somewhere deep in the system). The settings are also very, very slimmed down - which can make it hard to configure the tablet the way you might a stock Android tablet.App Support: It is still possible to sideload Android apps to the tablet (including Google Play), but you do so at your own risk. As with previous versions of Fire OS, not every Android app will be compatible. What concerns me, however, is that some of Amazon's own apps have performance issues despite being preloaded into Fire OS. Amazon Music, for instance, would not work the first time my tablet was set up. I had to factory reset just to make it work. Amazon's apps are also more frequently updated in the Google Play store than in Amazon's own appstore. I don't understand why they do things this way.I plan to keep this tablet for at least two years. I hope to get a lot of versatility from it. Hopefully you will as well._x000D_

  I am greatly disappointed with this tablet. Not because of performance but lack of control over configuration and available apps from the Appstore. Also preloaded with a lot of junk apps that I cannot remove. Unable to install more secure, privacy enabled browser. Built in Silk Browser isn't even configurable for increased privacy. This is only good for use as an ebook reader and video player for Netflix, Prime and Hulu. It's a shame because display and performance are cancelled out by Amazon centric operating system and preloaded junk. Will be returning and looking for a more consumer friendly tablet._x000D_

  Update:  keep encountering other buyers realizing too late to return that the device isn't a standard android tablet.  Service is so nonexistent that they're seeking help online on message boards.  Save yourself.cannot access owned apps through playstore. Non-US customer service just says sorry, no help. The device link to get service is stuck in an endless loop redemanding entry of a phone number.They did something to make the google play store not install, even though it would on prior models.Massive bezel, and this thing weighs a relative ton.Amazon should have just ordered some Samsung tablets and loaded them with their bloatware, which they also blocked prior methods of removal.Just trying to watch youtube is a nightmare, it resizes and behaves oddly unlike any other tablet on the planet. Don't know what they did, but apparently they hate google enough to make us hate Amazon with this tablet.Returned within 24 hours after fruitless chats with supposed service.I traded in my old fire tablet and used the proceeds to buy this piece of crap, which is not just money lost since Amazon doesn't provide service on trade in money if you return the device, again according to their lousy non-US customer ""assistants"".

  2 things.First pay the extra money so as not to be bombarded by ads every time you turn it on, switch app or it goes to sleep.Second, it says you can use an SD card for your own files.  however, its not easy and the normal apps don't work with anything that's not PURCHASED via AMAZON!In my opinion, this device has become an extension of Amazon's marketing department and no longer serves as a pleasure device for customers.This is one of those things you leaving you to wonder what happened to customer service in the retail industry_x000D_

  update 11/5/2019 9:33pm eastern3 separate support sessions, the most recent decided I needed an RMA. it arrived today and I decided to give it a shot, to continue with the support process.  loaded everything up, set it to charge and headed out for a little while.  upon my return, everything was wiped as before.  not surprised, something's up with the software on these things.  i did try the delete app cache/etc for kindle app itself on the fire, but that did not work either.  i havent heard back from the escalated person I was working with in a few days, but they definitely have some reading material from me when they are able to get to it.  stay tuned!original review text:after multiple support requests, amazon wants to ""replace under warranty."" there's nothing physically wrong with this device, it will just delete all of your downloaded content while charging.  its pretty much garbage software, the hardware is great though.  really frustrating._x000D_

  Fantastic product! My kids have a few fire 7's to beat around with, but wanted something a bit faster mainly for streaming and browsing.Extremely quick between apps, videos play without any issue, screen looks beautiful compared to past iterations.  Most bad reviews so far have been people trying to use incompatible accessories from past fire hd tablets that used micro USB.Fast charging time with 15w adapters and the type C port is a welcome upgrade.  Obviously if your not a fan of the amazon ecosystem or OS, then you might want to go with something that runs stock Android or iOS.  For the price and these specs, this tablet really can't be beat._x000D_

  Wow, with the sub-par reviews from the tablet snobs and geeks. This was 150 bucks! I bought three Fire HD8 tablets two years ago for me, my wife and daughter. Used almost daily and still like new. Replaced a Samsung 8 tablet that I was never really happy with. Love this upgrade. What a great size for watching videos, and the sound is pretty decent. A cheap pair of plug-in or bluetooth speakers will make it even better. Even better with headphones. Had a couple of friends with Apple tablets get these after they saw mine. I can shove mine in a backpack and tote it around carefree while they have to worry about damaging an expensive piece of gear. Now they are enjoying the Fire and don't miss the IPad. I can't speak for anyone doing anything other than watching videos, playing light games and surfing the internet. Oh, and reading! I love reading books and comics on this thing - even better with the bigger screen! Anyways, I digress, if you're into the things I mentioned then don't hesitate to buy this. At this price-point it is an awesome entertainment gadget, and I would never try to do spreadsheets or Power Point presentations for a million dollar deal (although it might do that?). Someone else mentioned that it doesn't do well with a Malware program. This is my third tablet and I have never had a problem with malware. Not sure why, but just throwing that out there. Never used anti-malware. I love these tablets and am really excited after putting this one through the paces!I have to add - buying the Amazon case for this is a must! Honest to God, I don't work for Amazon, but the cases that go with these are the absolute best and look and feel like they were built together. I admit the case is a little pricey but worth every penny. I bought an aftermarket case for the aforementioned Samsung tablet and hated it. It just felt ""wonky"", like a cheap glove._x000D_

  Bought the device for Kendle books so more text would appear on the screen.  I traded in my old Fire, first mistake.  The second, every time you open the damn thing, a game promotion is on sale for the deluded narcisttic toddler's priority emotional needs due what little lives the lead.  I cant remove the home screen Icons that prostitute the toddler's programs that Amazon is promoting for money.  Then there is the Alex screen, and only a total liberal idiot would allow Amazon or Google to intrude into their homes.  But, liberals need supervision, and the NEWS icon ensures they will never be required to make an intelligent t decision about politics based on facts.

  I had the previous version but it got stepped on. I got this one because of that. I was so sad when my other one broke but, in retrospect, it was okay because I LOVE the new one!The interface is sleeker. Even the icons are streamlined, giving it a higher end feel for the same great price.The graphics got an upgrade and you can tell. It's faster and the battery life is still impressive.I did have the opportunity to use tech support because the transfer process didn't work. In theory, you can use Amazon cloud to transfer everything on your old tablet to your new tablet. It didn't work, tech support was bluntly unable to help but it was literally the best bad results support phone call I've ever had. The rep was genuine, funny and you could tell that this was tech support, not customer service because he told me immediately that this was a known problem and wouldn't be solved. He thanked me for accepting reality LOL and moving on without yelling at him.The best thing about these tablets is the affordability. It puts all the Amazon branded entertainment in your hands at a reasonable price. The worse thing is the unavailability of some of the most widely used apps (like realtor apps, art apps and design app). The durability and affordability makes these tablets natural workhorses but the lack of access to basic apps hinders people from using them. That's a huge problem and that's where this review went from five stars to four._x000D_

  If you intend to add an SD card, to store large files (videos, movies, etc), then you are out of luck with the latest Fire tablets!After adding loads of files to my new SD card, when I inserted it, I discovered that the exFAT disk format is NOT supported. Almost every USB stick and SD card sold today comes preformatted with the exFAT file system, which supports large 4GB files.UPDATE:No reliable method for sharing files wirelessly. WiFi Direct IS NOT supported.Bluetooth file-sharing is buggy and intermittent. You have to try turning Bluetooth ON/OFF, at just the right time, to get devices to connect and transfer. This tablet will not share files, via Bluetooth, with Samsung phones. You would have to use a PC and USB connection, or an SD card to transfer files.So far, in my opinion, the Kindle Fire OS is a poor implementation of standard Android capabilities._x000D_

  The picture quality is excellent. You can really tell a difference from the previous version. The processor is also much faster. I also really appreciate the payment plan option. The micro sd card slot only supports up to 512gb so don’t spend a fortune on extra storage. Reading off the screen is very easy with the text sizing adjustment option.

  I purchased this because I needed an inexpensive device to read around the house.  It had to be light enough to hold without fatigue, have good battery life, and be able to run a selection of my Android apps. For the most part, it met my expectations.Price was very good. At $100, this was far less expensive than an iPad (which my daughter absonded with), the Pixel Slate (which though I still own, has lots of software issues), and other devices from Samsung (yup, good devices but out of my price range).Weight is not bad. It's not as light as the iPad but acceptable for my needs. Battery life seems very good. It took a while to charge, but I've been using it for a few hours and it's still above 80% charge.Main downside is that the Amazon version of Android doesn't have the Google Play app store. Amazon has a subset of apps including Netflix, various office tools, some games, HBO Go, etc.. These suffice for the most part, but installing Chrome browser requires downloading APKs and enabling supposedly insecure sources. Final nitpick is that the home screen seems like a big adspace for Amazon. I like Amazon but don't want it in my face all the time._x000D_

  My tablet had difficulty unlocking when it would come on. Then it would blink on and off not allowing me to view any screen. When the screen did stay on for more than a second, it would be for a game or other advertising that I would then have to swipe a dozen times to get to change to my home screen.  It would black out when I was looking at a screen and it wasn't like my other tablet that would time out and then I'd only have to swipe the screen to get it back up, it would appear to stay off or would start to blink and then  it was useless.  I also don't like the fact that I can't use any type of google application. This made it hard when my phone, which is google friendly, gave me more options of the types of apps I could download. On this tablet, if the App isn't on there, you can't get it. I don't like that a game suggestion or other advertisement comes up once the tablet is activated and there is no way around this.  I think something is broken with this particular tablet, but I got spoiled with the ease of my Samsung Tablet and this did not perform  well._x000D_

  The tablet seems fine, but be aware, you are paying for an ad machine. There are ads on the lockscreen and throughout the device.My kids can't go 5 minutes without asking about the latest ad they saw on my lockscreen.It apparently costs an extra $15 to remove.

  Update: OK, it finally keeps my books. the screen is beautiful and game play was nice and smooth. I still can't get it to let me load pictures via USB, well it might take 1 or 2 but then stops. So I'm still not thrilled as I expected it to be a larger faster version of my Fire 7 which is a breeze to load pictures to. I don't know, still working my way through forums to see if there is info out there. Amazon tech support has tried to contact me but only my work number is listed and of course it is always when I have gone for the day.Original: I really was excited to get the larger screen but this thing seems to bug central. It keeps deleting my books; I connect to PC and it will not let copy an files to the fire. I suspect the device itself may be ok, but the fire OS it runs sucks.

  The 2019 Fire HD 10 is significantly better than its 2017 predecessor.  The octacore processor does indeed make this bad boy 30% faster.  Fire OS 7.3.1.1 is the latest and greatest operating system.  The onscreen keyboard features a microphone key in the lower right corner.  This means you can optionally use your voice instead of the keyboard.  When it comes to the Micro SD slot, the Fire OS nails that too.  After inserting your Micro SD card into the slot, you can format it properly for use.  Transferring data to the Micro SD card is a simple matter.  The USB-C cord connects to the Fire much more securely and easily than a Micro USB. Format the Micro SD card properly, connect the Fire to a USB port via the USB-C cord to your computer, then transfer your data to the Fire.If you are a 2017 Fire 10 HD user, trade in your old Fire for this bad boy.  You will be glad you did :) Lastly, regarding the USB C to USB C charging option, the 2019 Fire HD 10 can be used with a fifteen watt charger of this type.  Use of a charger with more than fifteen watts would cause the Fire HD 10 to overheat._x000D_

  This is my 23 fire tablet and so far I hate it.  The home screen text is smaller at the largest size.  Text everywhere is outlined making it very hard to read.  The line showing video, books, apps, etc. at the top of the home screen is all in a white outlined text and an icon for the apps library overwrites it and can't be turned off.  Many of the screens have overlapping text, as if trying to squeeze too much in.  And after searching for the past hour it seems I can't change or customize any of this.  I don't care how much better the battery life is if I hate looking at the thing.  Wish I had my old HDX back, as far as I'm concerned the Fire tablets are getting cheaper and worse.  Going to buy a galaxy, name brand loyalty only goes so far.  And what happened to the Echo Spot?!?  I loved it, but all you can get now are the Echo Shows, and the ones I have have horrible distorted sound.

  The new Gen 9 HD10 is doing everything that Amazon promised so far. I also have many other Amazon items including the Echo Show. I really like that if I’m sitting in a different room, I can basically turn the new HD10 into an echo show by simply saying “Alexa, switch to show mode”. It’s also much faster than my previous HD10 which I traded in and pre-ordered this one. It arrived when they said it would, which is always a good thing. Fast easy setup, I chose to have it auto added to my account, it also gave me the option to restore all the apps, etc. that I had on my old HD10, that is, if you had one and you backed it up. In the past I enjoyed using a keyboard case with my last HD10 and was hoping it would work with this one it is an Amazon Fire HD 10 Keyboard Case (5th Generation - 2015 release). The good news YES it works, I didn’t have to do anything special just put the new HD10 in the case and the keyboard automatically hook up via Bluetooth. (See the picture). Now the bad news, while is works the new HD10 is just a little thicker than the old model and the case will not close, again see picture. Oh well, I knew it would be hit or miss and it’s a miss in this case. So, I little more expense to buy a keyboard case that will fit the new HD10. I’ll be waiting to see when one comes out. But I’ll sure be waiting for reviews/pictures to prove it does._x000D_

  Its much faster than my old HD 10 (7th generation).  I had one problem getting going.  I had purchased a 128 GB SD card from Amazon to go with the tablet.  The setup only took a few minutes then I put the SD card into the tablet. I've done this many times before.  You place the SD card in the slot than go into the ""Storage"" section of settings and touch the ""mount SD Card""  icon.  usually once you pressed this icon it would change to ""remove the SD Card"".  When I touched it the icon flashed then went back to its original ""Mount SD Card.  A couple of minutes later the screen when white with the notice ""reformatting the SD Card"".  The scale stayed at 20% for about 10 minutes when the screen went blank.  I pushed the on/off button and nothing.  After about 10 minutes I tried holding the button in to restart the tablet.  Nothing happened.  I called Amazon help during which another 20 minutes passed.  Once I explained my problem to the tech the screen lit up on the tablet and everything was normal and the SD Card was installed. Something happened but the tech couldn't explain it. The tablet ended up down for about an hour.  Also I just noticed there is no menu under the external storage  option.  My 7th generation gave me choices as what to save - there is nothing at all in the menu on the new HD 10,_x000D_

  if you are looking for ""out of the box friendly,"" boy are you in the wrong place.  This is my 4th Kindle tablet and including my first one when I was a complete novice, this is absolutely the worst as far as internet use is concerned. Oh, yes, I have connection BUT I CANNOT GET TO A SEARCH ENGINE PAGE.  I get these clogged up pages with buttons to push, NO search box at all, and syncing bookmarks from previous device is a complete (not funny) joke!  I hate this.  My old tablet did need to be replaced but I should have bought local so i could easily seek help.  Amazon help is sporadic and can be useless.  I figure I will eventually stumble on satisfactory usage but it hasn't happened in five days yet.  I admit, I am not technical, but I wasn't with my first three, and I did not have this much trouble.  Do not get this unless you are very comfortable with technical angles of set up.  I have been blindsided by how unfriendly this is!Update and this is not good:  some 6 or 7 months later.  You are aware we have had some major distractions during the months, so I have made sporadic attempts to synch my tablet to my printer.  Now, I can read the manual so I tried that route.  I have a pretty well known make of printer:  HP but when I clicked on the link to download the HP app, I got a ""sorry, that page no longer exists"" message.  I even returned several times to try, I suppose thinking it would suddenly exist again.  Anyway, yesterday, I decided to dedicate the time to call tech service at AZ.  The young woman who took my call was marginally knowledgeable and did seem to have some resources available, but OVER AN HOUR LATER, I was out of time (and patience) and she seemed out of ideas.  We parted amicably but the conclusion we reached is that there is no HP printer app available for Kindle 10.  I am still unable to use my wireless printer with this Kindle. And oh by the way, I frequently printed from my previous Kindle.  The block against HP was certainly hushed up in the promos for this tablet.  Grrrr._x000D_

  Mostly I'm disappointed. I know read the reviews. If you are buying it to watch movies and tv shows you will probably love it. It just arrived today. As I am checking it out it has jumped between non related things a couple times. Also unfortunately I will have to reinstall several things that I hoped would make the transfer. It seems as though Google is there almost every time I bring up anything that needs a password or try to open e-mail. I have difficulty seeing and have used kindles for years because I can adjust the print. On the HD 10 one of the first things I did was adjust the print size. Very disappointed. All of my kindles have the pop-up's left in, they never bothered me that much. Usually if you are not interested or occasionally offended by something you tap not interested, something else pops-up, you still have the option to tap not interested, but it doesn't necessarily change. Also you can no longer leave many of the pop-up until the clock runs out on it. No these are real commercials, you have to wait till the end before going back to your whatever. I loved both of my HDX's and my Voyager, my paper white, etc. More recently it seems kindles have become more of a kids toy. I asked what was the very best Kindle they had on the market today. I did not mention price or anything else, just what was the best. This was it. I have bought more than 20 kindles. This will probably be the last. By the way my HDX still works.Up date-I'm adding a star. I spoke with a pleasant representative, easy to understand,  knew the product. Finally someone acknowledged they didn't have an answer for why the print was so tiny, even though I had gone into settings increasing the size to the max. They transferred me to a Kindle rep. Immediately showed me what to do. Simple, straight forward, increases the font size for books. Wow!

  Books don't stay saved on the device or the SD card. I download them, and within 24 hours they are gone. Amazon tech support acknowledged that this is an issue with the latest version (9th generation) of the HD10. I suspect they'll have a solution in place soon, but until then the device is worthless to me. [Amazon is great about returns, so they sent me a prepaid mailing label so that I can return my new HD10.] I've been really satisfied with other/previous versions of the Fire (HD8, HDX, HD10), so this is a major disappointment._x000D_

  First off, the tablet came packed in a bigger box with absolutely no packing material.  I really expect it not to even turn on.  Second, when I turned it on, I expected to see the standard android screen, not a setup where I was required to hook up my wifi before I could do anything else.  But fine, once I did that, I discovered there is no browser, and even trying to go to the playstore requires logging into my amazon account.I could see that if I were buying a simple kindle book reader, but I thought I was buying a tablet.  The UI on the device is basically rewritten to be push amazon sales.  If I'd wanted that, I would have gone with the cheaper option and gotten the ads promoted version.This is nothing more than an advanced kindle.

  I would not recommend the 2019 version of Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet: essentially nothing works; not even the flagship uses cases of Amazon! It is bound to be a brick of no use! Essentially, only Alexa handsfree works … for a while!My tablet arrived with the screen protector delayed by 4 weeks. From the first day, the application of Amazon (and it flagship entertainment use case) did not work: it crashes with a persistence storage error massage or simply stays in a black screen – no video mode then crashes. More than one month later and after escalation across incompetent and useless support services and Jeff Besos executive technical support, it still does not work! Amazing! Also AFAIK, it is not possible to use browsing to play amazon videos nor does the app (that does not work) seem to support offline playing; which is also mind boggling for a mobile entertainment tablet… in short only Netflix works on it!Amazon curated applications (from amazon Appstore) also do not work! Many like 7Notes Premium, or Fuze meeting simply do not start when installed. Amazon technical support and VIP support then claim it would be not be supported by the tablet. Well if that is the case then it should not be available through the app store on the tablet! More important if that is the case then it means that checking what apps are available is worthless and that the ecosystem of applications you can run on it is so tiny that it is worthless! Indeed, for example United Airlines Entertainment application also does not run on it. This is again mindboggling for a mobile entertainment tablet! Without offline use of Amazon video and without ability to watch movies on planes… why would I buy this?Now, some more aps exists if you are willing to install google play. Yet again, many of the apps that would normally work on most devices have problems on the tablet (they crash). And Amazon, frankly in a questionable lawful approach, seems to try to make sure that it disables the play store every few days… Unless you have time to waste that path is a nightmare!Finally, on my second trip with the tablet (roughly 25 days after starting using it), it decided to lock me out: when booting, the tablet does not offer any prompt to enter the password or sometimes offers a prompt that does not let you enter the password. So I am locked out of the useless brick… And better yet now customer support and VIP technical support has gone silent! There has been a week that they are apparently researching what to do. Indeed, their inspire diagnosis is that there is something wrong with HW and offered to replace or refund (don’t really need that help to do that or dispute with credit card considering the above); yet because I am locked out, I can’t erase my data… So I can’t and won’t return the tablet thill that is resolved. One week later there is no solution or feedback provide by Amazon.And amazon VIP service suggested they would not offer any compensation! After year sof giving huge discount for any mistake, they won’t compensate for this?This tablet sucks. Do not buy it. Amazon customer service and focus has clearly degraded. Waiting to hear on the next steps._x000D_

  If you're like me, and don't upgrade for every single new release, you may be shocked at the amazing performance of the 9th gen Fire.My last new fire was a gen 6, which I loved and only upgraded because I cracked the screen. I was SHOCKED how the 9th gen is superior in EVERY way. Battery life, processing power, speed, screen...Screen. I've read a lot of complaints about the screen. Yes it's HD, and yes it lacks some color. But I'm not sure what the people are complaining about if they consider the price. The Samsung and the iPad are superior with color and DPI, but at triple the cost or higher, that's to be expected. If you truly need that much more resolution and color, than drop the big bucks, or drop the complaints.I'll keep this brief, because as I've already stated, this 9th gen blows away it's predecessors. Even the 8th gen.30% faster, yes, at least.Longer battery life? By leaps and bounds.Better picture? Big-time.Gaming capability? Smooth, fast and colorful.Sound? Waaaaay better.Processor speed? Feels as smooth and fast as my Galaxy 10 phone.""Easy"" to install Google Play Store. Find the YouTube video.What I'd like to see next gen, even if the cost goes up:Wireless chargingDirect access to the Google Play Store (this has Android OS)An OLED screen. They've come down in price so much, this should be feasible I'm gen 10_x000D_

  My Kindle Fire HD 10, 9th Generation arrived today, just as my previous Kindle Fire 7 HDX, 3rd Generation's battery finally died two days ago. So far, after 4 hours of troubleshooting 2 software issues, and opening 2 tickets with tech support, I am enjoying what does work.Here are the 2 issues which will probably occur with your Fire HD 10 too, if you use the Silk Browser and restore from a cloud backup from a previous Kindle Fire. Also a problem if you have an AOL email account and use the Kindle Fire Email App.#1. I restored the apps, bookmarks, etc from my stored Kindle Fire 7 HDX backup on the Amazon Cloud to this new Kindle Fire HD 10. The Silk Browser proceeded to load all of my Silk Bookmarks under ""Bookmarks"" and also under ""Favorites"".This creates a huge problem inside the Silk Browser which continues to crash and becomes downright unresponsive.After one full hour with a wonderful Kindle tech support man, we came up with temporary workarounds. In order to use the Silk Browser... I cannot close the last tab on the browser and I cannot add any new tabs. I can only access websites through the existing listed backups, or enter a URL in an existing window to access a new site.This problem has been reported to Amazon and he assures me that it's probably due to the new operating system and the ticket will go over to the developers for a solution.#2. I signed into my AOL email account using the Kindle Email App and my AOL contacts which should show up each time I enter a couple of letters to the TO: line, are missing. These same AOL contacts do show up using the third party My Mail App which I downloaded during the major AOL connection problem that existed with Kindle and AOL for six weeks from August through September.Linda, a great tech gal, wrote up a ticket on this software problem with Kindle's Email App and AOL email.She also assured me that the Kindle geniuses who built this version would get to the bottom of this new AOL/Kindle Fire problem. In the meantime, I will use the MY MAIL third party email application for sending my AOL emails.Other that these two glitches, I am enjoying my new Kindle Fire HD 10. It is very responsive and fast, which is why I waited so many years before buying a newer Kindle Fire. The specs on this unit are closer to the outstanding specs of my previous Kindle Fire 7 HDX from 2013.I bought a Fire HD 10 cover, and also a screen protector.I will be playing with this for a few hours and I will update this review if I encounter any other glitches.So as of this moment, I will give my new Kindle Fire HD 10 four stars, until the 2 issues mentioned above are remedied.I am counting on the Kindle Fire gurus to fix these problems pronto.It is now 11/11/2019.Here is an UPDATE:From my personal experience, the two issues I described above have not yet been rectified by Amazon technicians.My Silk Browser still will not allow me to open a new tab without crashing.As I mentioned above, this issue occurred because I restored my Silk Bookmarks from myprevious Kindle Fire 7 HDX to this new Fire 10 HD when setting up the new Fire.Restoring bookmarks from a backup causes the browser to enter each bookmark as a favorite and thisoverwhelms the browser causing a freeze and requiring a force stop and clear cache to restart the browser.The only way to open a new tab is to open it through a bookmark.Also my AOL email still shows no AOL contacts when using the Fire Email APP.The contacts are all there when I use the My MAIL APP, however.There is no telling whether either of these issues really matter to Fire techies.So I am still working around both problems.As for the Fire 10 HD itself... the battery is outstanding! It charges quickly and lasts for 2 days with my usage.The HD visuals are not as sharp as my Fire 7 HDX (2013, 3rd edition) however. That tablet was truly exceptional, as others have also mentioned here.Why Amazon tossed that technology is still a mystery to me.IAnother UPDATE , 11/11/19, LATER IN THE DAYI just discovered a follow-up email sent to me from Kindle Fire support sent to me on 11/07/19.This addresses the bookmark restoration from backups problem occurring with the Fire 10 HD.It appears that the developers recognized the problem as I described it and they have now fixed this issue. The fix will occur with an automatic Silk Browser UPDATE that will occur on 11/19/19.I hope this rectifies the problem.Here is the email response from Kindle Fire Support:On November 7, 2019, at 11:28 AM, cs-reply@amazon.com wrote:Message From Customer ServiceHello Susan,This is Obaid from Kindle support following up on our call earlier.I am writing you this email with respects to the bookmarks showing up as favorites on your Silk browser.I have reached out to the developers for the issue and they have fixed the issue with an update to the Silk browser. The update should automatically install maximum by November 19, 2019.in case you still have the same problem after November 19, please do contact us again so that we can further escalate the issue.I appreciate your patience and understanding in this case.Best regards,Obaid OAmazon.comAnother email response states that they are still addressing the AOL contact issue while utilizing the Fire Email App.Hopefully this will also be resolved soon!I11/21/2019 UPDATETHANK YOU FIRE 10 HD DEVELOPERS!The Silk Browser favorites/bookmarks problem has been successfully corrected.I can now open new tabs in the Fire 10 HD Silk Browser without freezing up and crashing the program.Also, the bookmarks are no longer replicated as favorites.Now I am hoping the Fire 10 developers will correct the AOL Email problem when using the Fire 10 HD E-mail APP.No AOL Contacts are available when using the Fire 10 HD E-mail APP.The AOL Contacts are available using the third party My Mail APP._x000D_

  This tablet is much faster than our previous Fire HD 10 which is nice. However if you accidentally touch the ""show mode"" writing at the top of the screen while pulling down from the top to check on wireless, and other operations, the tablet will not operate.  On my third to technical support I was told to ask Alexia to turn off the ""show mode"" to restore the tablet. It shouldn't be that easy to disable the device._x000D_

  The new Kindle Fire 10 uses a different charger than the previous versions. It is a USB type C not a standard micro USB charger. The charger that comes with the Kindle Fire 10 has a very short cord.  I tried to order a charger with a five foot cord.  The first order was advertised to fit the Kindle Fire 10 and did not.  I ended up ordering and returning three different chargers that were advertised as fitting but were too small.  I was sent to five different customer service reps and was assured that I was ordering the correct charger.  Their advertisers are giving out the wrong information.  Unless you want to be attached to the wall while watching something that drains your battery do not order the new Kindle Fire 10._x000D_

  Bought it on the Black Friday sale. I needed a cheap Android tablet and this looked like it would fit the bill. Solid performer, great screen, great battery life. There's just two catches:1. This is NOT Android out of the box.If you plan to use the Google Ecosystem, you are left with having to sideloading the Google Apps with questionable functionality on the device (no Gmail, no Calendar, etc.). This probably voids warranties and return policies as well.2. This is NOT a $100 Tablet.If you buy this specific version at $100 for Black Friday or Cyber Monday, your device will come with obnoxious ads on the Lock Screen page. To get rid of this you have to pay $15 extra... ooor you can play around with root privileges to get rid of this but I'm sure that DEFINITELY voids returns and warranties and will open your device to potential security risks or bricking your device.I only suggest sideloading / rooting because I NEED an Android Tablet. I NEED the Google Ecosystem. Even though it is Android, it certainly has none of it's perks.Aside from those problems, I think the device is great. Good touch screen, large display, screen quality looks nice, and it's in a slim but rather sturdy package. No problems outside of not being an Android Tablet._x000D_

  ...I'm not sure why people are expecting miracles out of this thing.As a person who currently owns the 2017 HD 10 (it'll be on it's way back to Amazon as trade-in fodder for this particular 2019 model) and being able to directly compare the two models side by side, I can tell you... You're not going to find a better value. Seriously.Yes, there's another big-box retailer who sells tablets of varying sizes and somewhat the same performance (quad-core processor, 2 GB of RAM) for roughly the same pricing, but those models pale in comparison to what Amazon has pulled off with these Fire HD tablets.The Fire OS runs smoothly on these devices, whereas stock Android tends to run sluggish on the competitor's devices because they're not optimized for the software/hardware. Amazon makes sure these tablets work, right out of the gate. If they don't, they'll either fix or replace it, immediately. Can't beat that.It's snappy, a good bit snappier than the 2017 with its quad-core processor compared to 19's octa-core processor. Sadly, Amazon hasn't figured out that Android-based devices need at least 3 GBs of RAM these days, 2 is really pushing the lower limits. (I know, I know, someone will come along and say Android doesn't need more than 2 and how it handles RAM differently from other OSs, etc. Heard it all before.) 3+ needs to become the norm on Android devices. That said, this thing moves.Start-up and shutdown are rapid and furious. 2017's took upwards of a minute to fully load at power on. It dragged and dragged. It was a nice tablet, once loaded and running, but the 2019 model utterly defeats it.Same 1080p panel (gorgeous, btw), better audio with actual Dolby Atmos whereas the 2017 model was just Dolby Audio (good, but not Atmos.) and yes, even the packaging of these devices denotes the change. (2017 says Dolby, period and '19 says Dolby Atmos )  and now USB-C for faster charging and data transfers. Same SD Card slot, but now takes a maximum of 512 GB for storage!So, basically, it has everything you want and makes it better. It just falls short of what you need (more RAM) and better customization.All in all, you're not going to find a better tablet with this level of performance, for the price. MSRP at $149.99 is fantastic. Black Friday and Prime Day pricing of $99.99 or less is INCREDIBLE. Buy it on sale and get a great tablet experience.Oh, and yes, it's Alexa powered/Show Mode capable. Just a button press on the screen and off you go.Update: Over a month later and this is my daily driver over my PC and my Pixel 2 XL. The display remains gorgeous and Disney+ and Netflix just pop and wow on this display. So worth the money._x000D_

  I wanted to love this tablet so so bad, but It falls just short. Today the market is oversaturated with crappy tablets that you can get for next to nothing. It seems like every company out there had to stick their fingers in the tablet market.  Examples being, RCA, Polaroid, Packard Bell, and the laughable ONN. All which should've never seen the light of day.  So when I was looking at the Black Friday deals on amazon, and first noticed a 10 inch HD tablet for $100?!?! I knew one of two things, it was either going to be a solid ""MEH"" or a good tablet..  Here is what I think....First I want to talk about the things I liked.  -The screen is sharp, crisp and clear. I have watched numerous shows, and movies on it and it has worked better than I thought it would.  -Sound quality is great, again for being a $150 (regular price) tablet with sound quality like that, is very very good.  -Processor speed is very good for the price, and it seems to respond very well.  I did notice some slow down when I was running a couple apps at once.Dislikes.  -Speaker location.  Both speakers, on the same side, can make the sound muffled with you have it propped in a case or leaning against something.  -Ram.  The tablet itself could use maybe one more gig of ram, that would help greatly. With the overall speed and responsiveness of the tablet itself.  -The biggest downfall, beyond so many things is the OS itself.  The tablet runs on some janky version of Android, which you would think would be great however, No Google Play.  That is the largest downfall that this tablet has and its quite a significant one as well.  If Google, and Amazon could make nice and make the Play Store available, this tablet would easily be a 5/5.  Until then I sadly have to give it a 2/5.  It's just hard for me to give it anymore than that.If you are on a budget but want a good HD screen, and you won't miss the Google Play store, then this is definitely the tablet for you.  If you are someone who needs HD display, Great sound, And the Play store, I recommend going after a good Samsung tablet._x000D_

  Bought this to replace my Kindle fire 7 (which I initially bought to experiment whether or not I’d like reading comics digitally and realized that I loved it...if only I had a bigger screen). Hence, why I decided to upgrade. Got home from work and was excited to see my package. I opened up the comiXology app (after having downloaded it) and then downloaded a few comics and opened them up! This is exactly what I wanted and needed! It’s perfect! Perfect comic book page size. I also have a kindle oasis that I use for “regular” books. Thank you Amazon for another great device. The only thing I’m upset by is the fact that my twilight blue case for my new kindle fire did not arrive on time.... so I can’t bring myself to use my new kindle until that comes in._x000D_

  One very frustrating and distracting issue with this Kindle is that the screen frequently dims for about two seconds and then goes back to full brightness. It is extremely distracting when reading.****UPDATED 11/13/19 ****Amazon tech department called me and stated an update to resolve the dumping of my contents would soon be available to download. It has been about three days since that download was installed on my device. So far it is working on both of my new Kindle 10 tablets, which is why I am editing this review. Additionally, the tech assisted me in connecting the tablet to my Echo using a different method.Overall, the larger size, longer battery life, and louder speakers are worth the short-lived hassle I first experienced on both of my new 10 tablets, which is why I'm updating my initial negative review.______________Dumps my entire library each night, every night, both books and audio books. It won't connect to any of my echo speakers, but it does show my next door neighbor's bluetooth headphones as an option!_x000D_

  ***Update*** I originally gave this tablet a 4 star prematurely. After having this tablet For a full 24 hours I realize the software to this device is horrible. One being the lack of apps in the Amazon app store. They also try to keep you away from using a third party browser and making you stick with their browser (which is not great).For $100 I'm satisfied. The speaker is crap and I thought the screen would be a little bigger but it's okay. One thing that is annoying is the auto brightness. It doesn't seem to be working properly and it's dark most of the time. You may want to change that to manual settings. This is not as good as an iPad or Samsung tablet but much better than those generic tablets from China.  If you want a basic tablet that is used for browsing and low graphic games then this is a great tablet._x000D_

  I tend to use my fire in bed.  This was way too heavy and way too large.  Oops.  That is my fault, not theirs and I have ordered a hand holder for the back I hope will work.Two other issues.I use Gmail.  They would not allow me to add my gmail app.  Said it had issues with hackers???  I have this on my PC, my other Kindle fire and two phones!  I used one of their all email in one app and I HATE it.  Very difficult to use.  Will search for another one.The other problem is probably trivial but irritating.  For some reason the brightness adjusts itself, no matter what I set it at (like when reading) it will get dimmer and dimmer until I cannot see and I have to re adjust.Does have a much longer battery life, which I love.  I also like how all is bigger on the screen and I can see things.I have not called the tech support about it yet.  I need to._x000D_

  Let me start this with, no I’m not an amazon fan boy, work for amazon, or received this free for a review. I received this tablet in place of one that was an older model that had an issue in which the remedy was to replace it with the current 9th Gen tablet. The old one pretty much spent its life in the living room or on the treadmill for reading. So I decided to give this one a go in lieu of just getting money back.In short, I’m pretty happy with it. Yes, the case is plastic and your married to the amazon ecosystem. But I will say, out of all the tablets I’ve had before this (yes...even the venerable HDX 8.9) the HD 10 with the octo-core processor is faster than them all. One could argue that it’s Android 9 (Pie) as the base OS, but it’s a definite improvement! The big plus for me is the micro SD slot, yes I have 64gigs on-board, but I also use a lot of storage for PDF’s and How-to videos. I like this unit for the price (which I will say is a heck of a deal)...and it’s not so crazy expensive that I’m scared to take it in the shop. Let me explain the “Shop” part. Aside from reading and consuming media like the masses, I house a ton of PDF manuals...service manuals to be frank. Some of these are 1000’s of pages of diagnostic information and electrical schematics. So being that it has expandable storage, it’s going to see more use than the last. I have this tablet in a hard case with a screen protector. I’ve been to the far reaches of the internet to gather a rather large collection of automotive material and it’s nice to be able to put almost 550gigs (OS and apps take up the rest) of stuff on a tablet that’s about $149-189 depending on base storage size. Big plus here.Battery life is almost a work day, and that’s pretty hard usage (using it during a job), some days are much more with just light browsing and reading in my off time, depending on screen brightness. Falls inline with what they claim.Alexa is surprisingly handy for cooking recipes, or just asking for some tunes (never used the assistant before) It’s decently responsive, kinda on the fence for the privacy aspect, but I like you can at least clear your history or view it, so kudos there.Amazon, ya done did good;) Only thing I will add to this review, please design a really decent PDF viewer of your own design that’s more intuitive (searchable) than the baked in kindle version, and you’ll knock this unit outta the park!Customer service needs a plug here, they handled my exchange to this unit quickly and I’m pretty dang happy with the outcome. Keep it up;)_x000D_

  This is my 5th Kindle. I replace every few years to get the upgrades. There are some really nice upgrades on this newest one. My only complaint is that it gets very glitchy when playing games. I have to restart about 85% if the time when I try to open games. Sometimes they just close down. There is one game I've never been able to close out of. The frustration came today when I bought extra lives to finish a difficult level and it closed the game. So now I'm losing money when playing games on this blotchy device. I've always given the Kindle Fires 5 star ratings. I will update my review of Amazon can get this fixed.UPDATE: Things appear to be working better. Now I have the Kindle I was expecting. I've played games, searched the internet, watched videos, listened to audio books etc, and I love this device. The new device feels lighter but has good picture and audio quality.

  The Good: It turns onCons: it’s garbage why? It’s full of ads to the point not even worth the time to try and shut ads off. You are forced to keep so much useless crap you don’t need but you can’t use stuff you may actually need. I’m an Apple guy and for good reason. This stupid tablet won’t let me check my Email( iCloud) it forces me to make a stupid gmail. Won’t let me do wix or fivver which both are importand. If I have any photos from my iPhone won’t allow me to use those on this Crappy  device Because it’s Apple pictures that at some point were on an apple product. They did finally allow YouTube but your very limited to what your allowed to search or watch not sure why? I can’t go on tik tok but I can install the app how stupid is that. Also can install a fivver app but can’t use it. Instagrams the same so why even offer those apps. Dumb this device sucks. Music don’t get me started if it’s not purchased off amazon don’t even bother unless you find it on YouTube if they allow the song search. Amazon’s the only place you can shop so don’t expect to go on eBay or Walmart only Amazon. Careful what you search for some I mean most searches are allowed.Hey this piece of crap is a good frisbee through mine as hard as I could into the wall. Somehow my wall survived. I hate that they push their book crap don’t care to read at all. They push prime Hulu and try and force so much crap on you it’s sickening. The price tag on this pays for Facebook that’s about it.

  Found a way to bypass the 4GB file limitation for fat32 that the tablet forces on the micro sd card. You must use the micro sd card as internal storage device instead of portable device storage, that will format the sd card as ext4 (linux file system.) That way you can transfer files bigger than 4gb straight through from your pc to your tablet straight into the sd card with the included usb to usb-c cable._x000D_

  I would give this tablet 5 stars if it didn't have an issue with 802.11ac (5ghz) connections.  It does not support all of the channels that 802.11ac has.  Your 5ghz aka ""Wireless AC"" must use a channel between 36 and 48 for it to see your network whereas 802.11ac supports channels 36-64 and 100-165.  So if your router is set for ""AUTO"" and auto assigns your 5ghz network channel to 52, 56, 60, etc. the Fire HD10 will not see the network at all.  Even if you manually entered the network in, it will not see it.Other than that, the Fire HD10 is a fantastic tablet and I highly recommend it!  Love the faster processor!  I definitely can see the difference between running the same app on my 2017 and 2019 Fire HD10's.  The Amazondroid (android) version is also updated on the 2019 tablet.I sure hope that Amazon pushes a possible firmware update on the wifi chipset to address the channel limitation or at least say something about your network having to be within a certain range of channels for it to work properly and if possible remove the cap of 433Mbps.  Not sure if it is a limitation of the particular wifi chip that they're using in the tablet itself.  It sure would be nice to be up there with my phone which connects to my Mesh network at a minimum of 800+ Mbps.Overall:  Highly recommend this tablet!_x000D_

  Got this item on October 30th. Opened it on November 4th to setup. The screen was twitching. Thought the tablet needed an update. Negative good buddy. Updated the OS and still twitched like a crack addict going through withdrawals. Called tech support. The rep took control of my tablet and said it wasn't twitching on her end. Well no crap it isn't. The problem is the panel not the internet connection. A bit more useless troubleshooting and she did exactly what I said to do at the start if the call, initiate replacement. After the rep said to send the tablet (which I've had opened for all of 40 minutes and had been released for 6 days) in and in about a week I'll get a replacement, I lost my mind. She put me on hold for 10 minutes to get approval to send me a replacement immediately.  Amazon tech support is useless._x000D_

  There really isn't a lot to say about this tablet in terms of bad for me. I'm not a techie so I won't go into all the details about that, there's other great reviews for that. For me it works amazing, battery last really long, screen is great, speakers are LOUD! The ads don't matter at all as it's only on the lock screen, so once you swipe to open they're gone. No big deal. I really love this tablet! The white is beautiful and with a 128gb sd card along with internal storage of 64gb I'm set for a long time. I almost never touch my 9.7 ipad pro anymore.

  In short, I bought the 10"" and it's plenty fast. It does what I want. As a techie, I'm happy with it. I can only write about my perspective as a power user and not the conveniences that other people use, like syncing and whatnot.I bought this off of eBay and saved almost $50. Had issues with registration, but the eBay seller and Amazon figured it out and now I'm good. (Major kudos to Amazon for not just telling me to get bent because I bought it from eBay!)For a $150 device, the 2019 Amazon Fire is amazing. I've never owned an iPad and refuse to pay that much for such a limited experience using iOS. This is a fantastic value if you install Google Play and use it as a normal Android tablet.I was able to push Google Play and install my own apps. It works just like a regular Android tablet with the FireOS skin. I am running 7.3.1.0. I did not root my tablet, and I don't need to.It takes a four-second push with the power button to turn on, then less than 10 seconds to boot up into FireOS. The UI is extremely responsive thanks to the octacore CPU and 2GB of RAM. I can bounce between apps with no issues. I've installed an SNES emulator, Google apps, Duolingo, TeamViewer... nothing has slowed this down. The hardware AND the software is good enough where I haven't noticed any lag. You are able to disable select packages and bloatware via ADB... check out XDA if you want more info on how to do this, but remember that some packages interact with the different ""tabs"" for FireOS.Multimedia performance is improved with the 2019 in comparison to the 2017. With the 2017, I had to use a volume booster APK to ""hack"" and amplify the gain for volume because it was so soft with the internal speakers. This tablet is plenty loud. I can hear voices and make out what's going on at full volume. I can listen to music in a room at full volume. In comparison to the 2017, this doesn't suck anymore. Screen resolution is great... because honestly, unless you're looking for pores on faces, you don't need 4K on a tablet, because you'll need to look at the screen inches from your face to appreciate 4K. (The normal sitting distance from the couch will assure you that 1080p is good enough... hell, 720p is good enough. Your media source needs to actually be at a high bitrate, not just at a high resolution... since anyone can extend a video to 4K resolutions but lack the image quality of what 4K can provide.)I'm coming from the 2017 Amazon Fire 10""... that was, for some reason, rather laggy with even Chrome. This tablet feels like a contender with my Samsung Note 8. (Spec-wise, it's no contest, but if it FEELS good, I have zero qualms.) I don't feel like I compromised with performance here... and I hate lag.If you are upgrading from a previous Amazon tablet, this is the tablet to get. If you are comparing the Lenovo, Samsung, and other brand offerings, this is still the tablet to get for battery life and basic needs. (If you will work off of a tablet to do things other than BASIC productivity, like email, word processing, etc., I would recommend you look for better specs... and thus, spend more money.) Amazon takes losses on these tablets to guarantee service delivery and profits from their store. This makes sense to them. For you, as the consumer, if you are looking for a tablet that will make you happy for most needs, this works very, very well.HIGHLY recommended._x000D_

  I absolutely love that they came out with an updated version of the Fire HD 10. Thrilled to have the white color choice not to mention the great price. Only downside to this item is that they changed the Power Cord to a ""USB C"" plug in so previous cords do not work with this newer version. The power cord that is included is very Short. I like a longer cord so I can use it while it's charging so had to buy new longer cords. Be careful ordering new cord as it needs to be USB C and not the Micro USB on previous versions. By checking the product description I was able to find the right longer cords here on Amazon and in a 2 pack. Just make sure if buying new that you get cord for the 9th Generation Kindle Fire._x000D_

  I switched from a Fire HD 8 7th Gen to this newest model. After using this for a week, I am super impressed. The first two things I noticed were the speed and the display. Eight processors make this  screaming fast. And the display is terrific - rivals the Apple iPads. It easily connects with Bluetooth devices, and stores connections in a separate folder so you don't need to constantly pair devices. Another neat feature is that you no longer have to flip a switch to sideload apps. Under Apps from Unknown Sources you now have a list of Apps that you can grant permission to, chief being the Silk Browser. Simply opening the Downloads folder in Silk and clicking on an APK file will allow you to sideload an App. This allowed me to sideload Adobe Acrobat and use the fillable tax forms to do my taxes this year. You can also easily setup Google Play following instructions at the androidpolice site.Load up some better apps from Google Play and you can do everything Microsoft Office can do. The Alexa function is OK, but doesn't have the features that an Echo device has. Useful for most functions, and great as a second TV or video calling. There is a PIP that allows you to work and watch some video features. I use Sling TV and it works just fine for that.The SD card function has been tweaked to allow for up  to 512 GB cards and to earmark the SD memory as either internal or portable. So now you have a tablet that rivals the storage capabilities of mid-priced laptops.My setup now has a hardshell case with a kickstand, SD card reader, OTG cable,  and a bluetooth keyboard. Now I can do anything my much costlier laptop can do. Faster, and at a far cheaper price. Will post more as I explore and get under the hood with Developer tools._x000D_

  When considering a tablet, one has to view value for price.  If this was a $500 tablet one would expect quite a bit more.  But in the under-$200 market, the HD Fire has some quality.  But there are some SERIOUS tradeoff issues.The first major negative:  NO CAMERA OR VIDEO APP.  What are they thinking? They have a front and back camera (albeit poor ones), but no app to make them work?  One has to go to the appstore and download a 3rd party app... and those apps are (thus far) only for camera, not video).  It is unimaginable that Amazon wouldn't include a standard camera / video app with their system.  That issue alone knocks this down stars.PROS:* Super fast.  I've timed several tablets using a special program that does a data search.  On the cheap $100 Asian tablets, the result can be as long as 10 to 14 seconds.  On the iPad (which nothing beats in hardware quality) the result time is 1/2 second.  The HD Fire 10 comes in at a very respectable 2 seconds.  That is quite fast... as fast as a Samsung costing twice as much.* Doesn't garbage up the system.  You will have plenty of memory left over in addition to the Amazon apps (unlike the Samsung and iPad, which both gobble so much internal memory you pretty much HAVE to buy high-RAM versions).  I do recommend the 64 gig HD10 rather than the smaller version.  It is definitely worth the extra bucks.* Considerably more powerful than the HD7 or HD8 tablets.  (Unfortunate.  I would love to see an HD7 with the power of the HD10... and of course would expect a price to match.)  If you want speed and power, the HD10 is the way to go.* Light weight and easy to  hold.  This may seem trivial... unless one has tried to hold a tablet twice the weight for a half hour or longer.  Light weight then becomes important.* Awesome battery.  Asian tablets almost always cut corners on the quality of the battery and RAM... resulting in a slow system with a low battery life.  Amazon does not cut corners.  The battery is good for a solid 10-12 hours and charges very quickly (3-4 hours for a full charge, depending on the charger power).  Charges even faster if one hasn't dropped below 50 to 60%.  The battery life is one of its best features.* Good quality screen.  Note, good quality, not great quality.  It's not going to stack up to a $500 Samsung or iPad.  But for the price, it's quite good.  Does tend to fade out terribly in sunlight.* LOTS of case options and accessories.  A good case that meets my needs was very important.  The Fire has case choices... plus screen protectors, special chargers, etc.  No shortage of options.* And importantly... THE BEST SUPPORT of any tablet I've ever seen, bar none.  It's obvious that Amazon really wants their customers to be happy with the Fire HD10.  This makes sense because they use it to support Kindle, Amazon Music, Amazon Cloud, and more.  I have never seen tech support so easily available, friendly, knowledgeable, and bend-over-backward helpful in supporting a product.CONS:Not many.  But they are significant.* The ""no camera/video app"" mentioned above.* The new USB-C version has lost its prior direct-to-PC connect ability.  If you hook the tablet up to a USB port, rather than being recognized as an external storage device (as it did with the prior micro-USB version), it finds no data on the Fire HD10.  This is a shame; the ability to directly transfer data is a major plus, and a severe loss on the new version.  (It appears the USB-C is used for charging purposes only rather than data transfer.)  This is a VERY BAD decision.* Worst cameras on the market.  2 megapixel front and back camera.  This is in a field where even cheap $100 Asian tablets support a minimum of 8mp x 5mp, and often 16mp x 8mp.  Honestly, even with the low price of the HD-10, Amazon could have ramped up the camera a bit to decent 1080p webcam quality.* No GPS or magnetometer.  That and the camera are corner-cutting biggies.  Magnetometers are usually used for apps like compasses and may or not may be important to the average user, but the GPS... that's a big miss.Poor camera, no GPS and no data connectivity is why I give the HD10 only 2 stars instead of five. Almost gave it 3 stars, but these are three major issues.* In my opinion you'll want to buy something other than the official Amazon case (almost anything else).  It's over-priced, under-functioned and does not provide a proper stand with varying angles.  Fortunately there are lots of alternatives.* If you want Google programs you will have to custom-install them (including PlayStore).  The HD10 does not come with PlayStore or any Google-based apps.  Apps that require GPS will not work at all.  If you want a camera app with video you will need PlayStore.* There seems to be somewhat an issue of ""defective out of the chute"" problems.  I had to return the first tablet they sent me due to (most likely) RAM issues.  My friend had to return his due to an issue with Alexa not connecting properly to wireless (all other programs did, just not Alexa... and one can't remove and replace the hard-wired program).  So be sure to check your tablet for ""glitches"".  However, if you get a good one... it's a quality tablet.Summary:  My primary purpose in purchasing the HD10 is low cost, quality equipment and SPEED.  It is amazingly fast for this price range, and speed is important to me.  In a field where quality tablets are running $400+... at less than $200 (a little over with tax) the HD10 is a viable Android-based choice.  And it's awesome for those who wish to access Amazon-based products with ease (Alexa, Kindle, etc).  If one can tolerate the downsides (use a cell phone camera instead of the tablet camera, and sigh... do without GPS and USB connectivity) it's a decent tablet.  But its downsides are not insignificant.  They could have done better._x000D_

  So, I will start this review with a TL;DR- Sometimes I'm willing to pay less for something, knowing that it won't be as good as something that cost more, but I'm ok with it, because, for the price, the item is good enough.  This tablet is NOT one of those items.  Not worth it at any cost (ok, maybe like $25).I took a chance because there were good reviews.  My kids both had a kids version kindle from 4 years ago that I hated.  But i thought that maybe it was just because it was a kids one that it was so bad, or that quality had improved.  Nope.  I hate this tablet.  First- although not an issue with the tablet itself, I bought this mostly to play Catan Universe with friends during quarantine.  I got to play one time with them, then all other tablets got an update, which made it not possible to play with them anymore until Fire tablets got the update.  And that update never happened.  Last time I checked for the update, the game wasn't even available on a Fire anymore.  So, while not the tablet's fault, I did check before I bought to make sure that I would be able to play with friends.  And now I can't- and the updates don't come, due to some fault of Amazons requirements (or something).  Second- I will search for something on the internet, I will hit the link I want, and it will take to me to Apps store to buy some random app.  So I have to exit and start over.  It will usually connect me to the correct website on the second try.  Third- if I tilt it wrong, the screen goes blank.  I'm still not quite sure what I am doing when that happens, so I don't know how to not do it.  Forth- After I gave up on it, I kept it so my son could do his school work on it, since *most* of his apps for school are available on it.  But now the apps keep messing up.  Maybe there's another update that isn't available to us yet (or ever).  I've deleted the apps and downloaded again, to no avail.  So, every 30 seconds, he has to come ask me for help (he is 6, so doesn't always know how to fix the problem himself).  And I am trying to work from home, so this tablet makes that harder.  So, basically, it does nothing that I want it for._x000D_

  I ""upgraded"" from the HD8 and got the HD10 today. Setup was easy and I want to love it because it looks great, but the native speakers are not good, so I connected it to my Echo Spot via Bluetooth, hoping that would be better. It keeps disconnecting from Bluetooth about every 2 minutes, which stops the playback feature. It's frustrating. I am hoping it's just a firmware issue or something but if not, I will have to return it. :-/Edit: I found out it's an issue with the compatibility of the HD10 and the Echo Spot, in particular, and swapping it to my other Echo unit has mostly fixed the disconnects. The bluetooth connectivity is still not great though, as it often lags behind the picture and even freezes sometimes, though it is staying connected. My Echo units are older units, and that seems to be why the tablet is having BT issues. I'm hoping the new Echo 5 will solve the problem, but I really shouldn't have to buy all new devices just to fix this.The tablet itself is beautiful, and while it's a bit large for my hands, it's really nice for watching movies and tv in my home office. I do think the HD8 fit my hands better for overall portability and ease of use, but since I'm mostly keeping this one plugged in at home, I don't foresee the size being a problem. If they can fix the BT-to-Echo issues I'll give it 5 stars!_x000D_

  The Kindle Fire 10 hardware is good. It has a fast processor, the screen is nice and the battery life is good. The form factor is a bit strange, since it is so much taller than it is wide. The problem with the device is the software. In particular I'm referring to Amazon's Kindle software.For years I have been using an iPad with the Amazon Kindle application installed. In computer years the iPad is getting old. Also, the iPads don't have great battery life. If I read on a weekend day, I often have to plug it iPad into a portable battery charger. Not wanting to buy yet another Apple device at inflated Apple prices, I bought the Kindle Fire 10. The idea was that I would have a tablet computer that I could read Kindle books on and other applications, like a web browser.  Since this is not an Apple device I would also be able to purchase books directly from the app. As it turns out, the Kindle Fire 10 was a mistake.The Kindle application repeatedly crashed. I contacted what passes for customer support on Amazon. I described the problem I was having with the Kindle app. The first email was not read by a human because they described issues with non-Amazon applications. I tried several things that they recommended and eventually was able to update the system software and the Kindle application stopped crashing.When I updated the Kindle app I discovered that my PDF technical and scientific books were not displayed in the Kindle app. They are now in a separate ""Documents"" app (this took me a while to discover).I find it shocking that Amazon's flagship app, the Kindle Reader, does not work as well on the Fire 10 as it does on the iPad.Perhaps the reason the Kindle app works better on the iPad than the Fire could be explained by the huge user base of the Apple iPad. When it comes to software, perhaps Amazon makes sure  that the software works on the Apple iOS devices. The Fire, with its smaller user base, has less priority.  If this speculation is true then you have to ask yourself if you want to buy a device that Amazon is not committed to enough to make sure that the software is as good as the software on the iPad.For me this was a $200 experiment. I should have bought a newer iPad. Unfortunately I don't have an easy way to return the Kindle Fire to Amazon since I live overseas where mail back to the US is difficult.This device was bought on my wife's account which is why it doesn't show as a ""verified purchase""._x000D_

  So I'll start off with the biggest glaring flaw of this device - the fact that it's lacking a lot of basic Android features. You don't get Google Play Store at all, you're instead stuck with the Amazon Appstore which is a tiny fraction the size of Google Play Store. You don't get a lot of Google Play services either, meaning you don't have access to any Google features. You're also completely stuck using the default Fire launcher, meaning you won't be able to customize your Android experience like you would be able to on any other Android tablet. No custom launcher, no custom screens, no custom anything. You're stuck with the advertisement-laden Amazon stuff and you can't change that without potentially voiding warranty.Which at the end of the day is understandable, I guess. Not ideal, but understandable. Because what you're getting here is basically a much higher price tablet that's subsidized off of the fact that it's also serving you ads. At its discounted price of $100 it trades blows with the similarly discounted $160 Samsung Tab A 10.1 in terms of sheer specs, losing only in terms of build quality (plastic versus metal), camera (this thing's camera is trash), and Android customization (again, Fire OS is far from good). In terms of value, this thing is basically the best of the best if you can live with its trade offs.Of these trade offs, the worst is by far Fire OS. Amazon would be able to do MUCH better if they used stock Android with Amazon apps pre-installed. Basically the same effect without being anywhere near as annoying as Fire OS. Fortunately, this is the one aspect of its flaws that's actually fixable. Or at least partially. Using third party tools you can sideload all of the missing Android stuff onto the tablet. Using the toolbox it even only takes a few clicks here and there, finishing up in a few minutes. It's not a perfect solution and it does potentially void warranty, but it also gives you back Android functionality that you wouldn't have otherwise.And of course, if you don't mind only using Amazon Appstore apps, that's fine as well. You have access to all the basics such as Youtube, Netflix, etc. If all you want from this tablet is for it to be a basic media consumption device, then it's really quite good. Heck, I'd say the screen is extremely good at this price range. Even moving up to mid tier I'd say this screen holds up quite well. A tad too reflective so it's not great for outdoor use, but it's very sharp and colors are very good. The two speakers, though annoyingly placed on the side, are also very good and get pretty loud. Not quite the most rounded sound, but very solid for a tablet and far more than I expected for the price.Not only are the basic media functionality stuff very solid, but the battery on this thing is a beast. Amazon lists this at up to 12 hours, but I generally get closer to 15 at 60% brightness doing web browsing and watching Youtube and Netflix. It's funny because usually manufacturers overestimate battery life by a bit, but Amazon seems to have grossly underestimated battery life. Not a common problem to have, and certainly not an unwelcome one. All of this combined makes for an extremely solid media consumption tablet.That said, the one thing holding this back that you can't do anything about is the RAM. At 2 GB, don't expect to be playing intensive games or doing much multi-tasking at all. It's a bit disappointing given the 8 core 2.0 ghz processor is quite good and is more held back by the limited RAM more than anything else. It's not a big knock against the tablet since lower end tablets all only have 2 GB RAM, but it definitely hampers the processor performance more than any other factor. If it was bumped up to 3 or even 4 GB this thing would be a monster, but unfortunately it's a budget tablet and consequently it has budget tablet limitations. Update: Looking at the new Fire HD 8 and its 3 GB RAM makes me rather annoyed that the larger more expensive Fire HD 10 didn't get as much RAM. The 10 still has a vastly superior CPU with 8 cores instead of 4 and better tech overall, but given how much RAM holds it back it still stings.This is the budget tablet for me, but perhaps not for everyone. If you're not tech savvy enough to sideload things (it's really quite easy, look for the toolbox and just follow the very simple instructions) I'd say you're better off paying 50-60% more for the Samsung Tab A on sale or some cheap brand like Dragontouch or whatever. Fire OS holds this tablet back the most out of everything compared to other tablets in the budget category. But if you're willing to just use this as Amazon intended or if you're willing to do some minor hacking, this thing is really great value for the price.9/10 for me. One of if not the best tablet in this category and price bracket. Highly recommended, though with the above caveats._x000D_

  I always look at negative reviews with what I think, is a critical eye. Because of this I usually saw those reviewers as outliers. Unfortunately, i am now to be a negative-reviewer.I've  had many Kindle devices over the years, each with their own bugs and limitations. But this situation, is maddening.I can't  afford wifi, so I had to drive through plaguetown for a hotspot to setup the device. That was simple. I also downloaded a bunch of books, movies, and songs.  Two days later, my books have dissapeared.  Everything else is there.I figured that I must have made some sort of mistake, so once again I drove to the hotspot and downloaded my books. This time, I made sure that the books would open, after i turned off the wifi. And they did. But again, a few days pass, and all the books have dissappeared.I figured that Amazon Customer service would be one of the few jobs that were secure and properly staffed during a pandemic, but I was wrong. It took half an hour to get through a maze of hurdles; a covid-19 recorded message that hangs up. Then to the site, on my phone, where my password was no longer recognized. When i set the new password,  I then was directed to download the amazon app. I did this, and was vonnected to a couple of sleepy-people, reading from stiff prompts on a screen, asking me elementary questions.Did I mention my truck blew a head-gasket, and I'd have to walk my 52 year-old Multiple-Sclerosis behind, to a hotspot if i needed one? Well i needed one, to run the tests that they could monitor, etc, etc...I didn't walk. I thanked the csr and waited to call back when I was able to Drive to a hotspot.In the meantime, I decided to write the review.I would have given the Kindle Fire HD10 five stars, but what good is a Kindle that can't hold books?_x000D_

  I've had several Kindle Fire tablets and given them as gifts. I've always been very happy with these tablets. Not so this time. It was sold as a new tablet (not refurbished) but arrived registered to someone else (hi,Barry) and even had his payment method still on it. Luckily, I'm an honest person and immediately deregistered it (you're welcome, Barry,) reset to factory settings so that information would no longer be accessible since I planned to return it. I contacted customer service, explained that I wanted to return the tablet as I had paid for a new tablet, but been sent a used one. Instead the customer service rep attempted to register the tablet to my account - at which point he discovered it had been reported lost or stolen. ( He said that was a ""glitch."" ) I never did seem to make him understand that this was not the new tablet I had ordered and I wanted to return it. Instead he registered to my account and I just have up. I guess I'm stuck paying the new price for a used ( or lost or stolen) tablet. I understand why Barry didn't want it. It periodically decides to reset itself and I have to register It all over again and reload all of my stuff again. It freezes frequently. When typing, I have to stop frequently to allow the text to catch up and the cursor seems to pretty much do whatever it wants. Autocorrect makes incomprehensible changes - my favorite being ""darling"" to ""daredevil."" Sadly, I think I would really like the Kindle 10 if it was one of the ones that worked properly. But I think Amazon knows this tablet is possessed and that's why they don't want me to return it. They're afraid they'll be visited by some horrible misfortune - boils, locusts,pestilence, possibly even taxation. Barry knew._x000D_

  Picked up this unit during the early Black Friday Sale...  Really love it.  If you have ever used an Amazon Firestick/Cube/4K...etc., this is just more great technology of that great system. I got the 64 GB storage upgrade, but you really don't need to.Really snappy CPU, great tablet picture, I have the 10.1 inch size and suitable for my needs...  Amazon and YouTube videos run in full HD quality...pretty long battery life, easy to lower the screen brightness and get more length of time for use.If you are a little adventurous and have some minimal Android knowledge, one can ""sideload"" or ""add"" more programs and apps on the Fire HD so you can have access to most everything out there for Android devices.  There are YouTube videos that can help you with that. By the way, this is not an ""Apple"" supported product, per se.The price point is what really got my interest.  Yes, you can spend twice the amount and get a name brand tablet or Chromebook, but this is gonna cover your needs.  I added a protective case, bluetooth keyboard and mini mouse.If you are on the fence, only need at the outset a ""basic"" system to look at emails, watch YouTube videos, light gaming or light surfing, do not hesitate and give this one a try.  It works right out of the box.  I am going on a long airplane trip/adventure, and selected this unit because of the ""compactness"" and ease of use.I have subscribed to some Amazon services, but you do not necessarily need Amazon Prime, Unlimited Music or other services to get a good experience from HD Fire 10...  Initial setup  will ask you to add an email account and register...  I suggest you at least use the Amazon email account for seamless operation.Just get it and enjoy..._x000D_

  I have read a number of these reviews and some people simply need to do a quick google or even silk search and they will solve most of their problems...FIRST thing to do when you get this thing is side load google play store... Extremely easy to do just simply search for this and many sites will tell you how to do this. Then you can install almost anything from the play store.I read 2 reviews that this would have solved all their problems... First one was complaining about YouTubeTV... installs and works fine from google play store... Someone was also talking about Pintrest and its on the google play store as well.Now for the 2 little things i have found so far... I could not find Netflix on the google play store which was odd but it was on the Appstore that comes with the fire so i installed it from there and it works fine.The one thing that is annoying is that when you put in a SD card if you want to copy movies or what not to it... it only supports FAT32 which will not allow a file larger than 4gig.. I was trying to copy a movie and it just kept showing nothing... I was a little lost at first so i took the card out and tried with it not in the tablet and that's when it gave me the error that it could not copy a file that size. So if you have movies larger than 4gig you wont be able to copy them to the SD card.So i only bought this because it was 100 bucks on black Friday and i must say it works amazing for what you get!!_x000D_

  Beware!  I got this because I wanted to upgrade.  There was nothing wrong with the one I had.  When I saw the trade in program, I thought I would upgrade.  Amazon offered me $30.00 so I figured okay let me get a newer with more options one.  WRONG!  First of all, when they received my trade-in, they only gave me $5.00 for it, claimed it wasn't working which is absolutely not true.  It was working fine.  I wiped it clear of my data, packed it in the box with the bubbles I received with the new one for which I paid over $100.00 and shipped with the label they sent me, so I know it wasn't broken.  I called various times, each time spent nearly an hour on the phone to no avail.  I even have an E-mail from them saying they will credit my account the $25.00-three weeks later...nothing.  The best is that the new one isn't any different than the old one?  I got stiffed twice, once on the trade in and once on the new one which has no improved functionality...really disappointed in AMAZON and how they treat their Prime Customers._x000D_

  When I first received this kindle,  I was afraid of it, it had so much more than my older one. After a day or  two of living with it and with the help of your tech support, who by the way, was so patient and knowledgeable, I was navigating it like a pro. And yes, I can ask Alexa anything I want.I am an avid reader and this kindle is so easy on the eyes and the greater screen space is wonderful. I was also amazed at the battery life, it is good for a couple of days with out charging.This was a gift from my two best friends, I thank them over and over again !_x000D_

  I bought this tablet to replace my 2+ year-old Fire HD 8 tablet.  I mostly use it to watch videos in the gym, or when I'm  traveling.  That being said, this is a great value.Besides being larger, the HD 10's screen is full HD (1080P), while the HD 8 was 720P.  The new screen is definitely easier on the eyes.The battery life is listed at 12 hours, and while I haven't pushed it, I can say that I've had no problem reaching 10 hours of use on more than one instance.While the processor isn't a speed demon, it is a nice bump up from the HD 8 processor.  While watching videos, browsing the internet, etc., I never found an instance where I thought things were sluggish.  By tuning the OS, Amazon has made this perform quite well with cheaper hardware.Amazon tries to lock you into their app store with their Fire OS, but you can easily add the Google app store by following any one of many tutorials on the subject.  There are even Youtube videos that show you how.  That opens you up to many more applications.Since I sometimes use this to connect to my home computer via Remote Desktop, I got an external Bluetooth mouse.  It makes navigation so much easier.Finally, while no different from the HD 8, the integration with Prime Video makes this a great viewing device for Prime users.If you just want a tablet to view videos on, browse the internet, or get on Facebook with, this is an excellent choice.  While inexpensive, it should be more than able to do the job for you._x000D_

  This is my sixth Kindle and 9th amazon device and it is pure insanity that I continuously purchase these worthless products. Just like the older generations of Fire tablets, amazon freetime is insanely useless and malfunctions every time I try to fix the initial problem. Apps are not downloading. I get errors frequently and my purchased apps are not installing on the freetime profiles. Can’t get a hold of amazon because of Covid and I am beyond frustrated with these tablets that I purchased for my kids so that they could continue their learning opportunities now that school is closed down. I don’t even want my money back, I just want these things to work as they should. I have only downloaded 4 apps, 3 movies, and 10 books on each tablet. My children bring me their tablets daily because of error codes, apps not loading, and crashes. Also, amazon echo devices suck too. Amazon should just leave the electronic products to the competent companies and just stick with deliveries._x000D_

  I own a Fire 7 which still works great and also owned a previous generation of the 10, which I had to trade back when the socket for the charger stopped working. I ordered a new Fire 10 but could not configure the email app. I assumed it was a fluke and returned it. I ordered another but found out it has the same bug. After working with Amazon help for six weeks (they did not call me back, did not email me, and closed the tickets without telling me), they insisted that I needed to work with my service provider. Every time my provider tried to help me, the email app crashed. They have run out of suggestions. (The app worked great on my first two tablets.) The app cannot be used. Since that was the main reason I ordered the Fire 10, I am very unhappy. Amazon refuses to listen to me and I will be returning this tablet as well. There are other bugs, too. I had problems registering both tablets and Free Cell works differently on the current tablet than it did on the other three. (This is a bunch of fun but is obviously a bug.) Some websites do not work as they did on the other tablets. Amazon will not listen to me and keeps telling me to contact my provider, then they close the ticket. Do not buy this tablet. I am fed up with Amazon.A year later, my tablet lost color display. Still can't email. It requires its own recharger so that the dozen that people already have in the house cannot be used. Maybe that is the way they fixed the fact that the old Fires lost good connection and could not be recharged any longer._x000D_

  I got this tablet for the express purpose of note-taking in grad-school. I have ended up mostly using it to watch Netflix and Hulu because that is about all it is good for. (It would be nice if it was good for Youtube also, but it is not.)This tablet is unable to connect to the wifi at my school. They do have an unusual security setup with their wifi, but this is the only device I have that will not connect. I can still take notes in class, but it sure would be convenient if I could look things up online, go on the course website, or even check my email for information.The physical keyboard I got for this does not work well either (Finite Keyboard Case). I am not sure if it is actually the keyboard or if it is the tablet, but in either case, if I am in the middle of doing something and turn on the keyboard, it will ""go back"" without warning. Sometimes ""going back"" means it deletes one letter in the text box; sometimes, it means closing the application I have open and I loose whatever I didn't have saved.The apps available for this tablet are also a joke. My bank does not have an app available; Duolingo does not have an app available; and many other apps I expected to have here, were not available (and I am a minimalist when it comes to apps). The internet browser crashes often, and the email application will sit on an outgoing email for an indeterminate amount of time. The only thing this tablet does better than my phone as far as apps go, is it is a better e-reader and Netflix/Hulu device because the screen is bigger. Other than those things, I just use my phone.The screen does not do well in bright environments, even when turned up all of the way. The battery life was great at first, but now these seven months later, it is only okay. The only good hardware feature is that the speakers aren't too bad. They aren't great, and they don't turn down very quiet before turning off, but the quality is better than my phone and is about on par with a good pair of laptop speakers.I did not realize when I bought this, but you cannot change the lock screen. It only ever shows you adds for things (and so far not a single add for something I was remotely interested in). Mostly the adds are for mobile games (which I never play), shows coming out on Prime (which I don't have a membership for, and don't care to), or sometimes something miscellaneous like an add for the cell phone company that I already use. Also, whenever I change the regular background picture, it changes itself back somewhere between an hour and a few days. I gave up the fight there pretty quickly.If I am going to use this to read books, take notes, and generally do good and useful things, then I don't want to be bombarded with advertisements, have my work deleted, be kept offline, and have the background picture of my wife be rejected.As it stands, we generally use this to watch movies, and I am thinking of a way to mount it on the wall to have a digital calendar because it would be more useful doing that than what I bought it for.Update: I have found that the Amazon Video app downloads random movies and TV shows without any input from me. It doesn't just download things from my watchlist either; I have found movies downloaded that I have never watches, have no interest in watching, and have not even visited the page for. (No kids, etc. have access to my tablet). I have pretty limited bandwidth at home, so I don't like that it will download movies and entire shows by its own volition._x000D_

  I just upgraded from the 7th gen to the newest 9th gen Fire Tablet 10 and the improvements are well worth the cost. Things I have noticed are, faster smoother operation, better internet speed  and battery life is much better. The only thing they have missed is higher quality screen but hey, $99 black Friday sale this is a win all the way around. I had the adds removed and I have sideloaded google play so you can get more apps/games for those curious about that and I am having an issue trying to get Disney + to work.12-12-19, So far so good, I have had a chance to run the new Fire 10 9th generation thru it’s paces and I am impressed, no slowing down or bogging down like the previous generation would with little use. I have downloaded several HD movies that only took a few minutes and playback quality is great but I do wish it was in 4K. For some reason Disney + still will not work and I have noticed Facebook can be a little glitchy at times. One thing I would change is color, I know petty but I went with black again but now I wish I had chosen the blue.1-1-20, so far so good, the only thing that has changed is the tablet has started to slow down and become sluggish , a simple reboot will correct this but that should not be required. Disney plus still does not work but at this price point I am not surprised._x000D_

  I traded in a 7th generation model for the newer 9th generation model, thinking that there would be at least some noticeable improvements.  The display is sharper, the battery life is better, and the newer device seems to be a bit faster than the older one.  Unfortunately, I'm experiencing a problem with the new one that I didn't have with the older one.  When I received the new unit, my grandsons started playing Candy Crush Soda, one of their favorite games.  Almost immediately they told me that the game was not working, so I asked them to show me what happens.  What happens is that when they touch the screen to make a move, nothing happens.  Even if they tap the screen several times nothing happens. The only way to fix the problem was to restart the tablet which grew old very fast.  I contacted Amazon tech and explained the problem, but they didn't have any solution so they replaced it with a new one.  Sadly, the replacement tablet has the same problem.  On both tablets I updated the system, but that didn't help.  I don't know if there is any kind of setting to fix the problem, but if anyone has a solution I would appreciate knowing what it is.  Although the issue is almost constant while playing that particular game, I have experienced the same problem when using various web sites.  I could get another replacement, but I'm not confident that it would work any better than the two I've tried so far._x000D_

  I absolutely love my new kindle fire. I've never owned one before, and I really wanted a tablet to read and to take on trips that had a large enough screen so my eyes wouldn't hurt. I bought a Finite Keyboard and Case for it as well, as I write books as well and my computer at home is always updating and not very useful. I wanted something smaller without having to buy something expensive. This kindle is perfect for me. I bought the 64 GB and in the white color and it's beautiful. The sound and picture is awesome too, I love watching movies and tv shows on it. I've never had Alexa before, so the built in Alexa was definitley handy and it's fun to use. Setting up the table was very easy to do as well and it synced with my android device. I've only had it for a couple days now, but I am very pleased with my purchase._x000D_

  this is the most honest review you will ever read on this product, basically you can't play games, you can't do music on it, you can't use it for video edits, you can't use it to edit word or pdfs, basically it is an expensive web browser and specifically the amazon version which tracks everything you do and links you to their store for you to purchase things, if my work did not pay for this I would have NEVER gotten it, any cheap android operating tablet is better than this, basically this is an amazon product designed to redirect you to purchase more amazon products.

  Upgraded from a 2017 Fire HD 10 tablet for the USB-C and faster processor.  The Fire HD is used for travel and not everyday.  The new one is faster, boots faster, and has a great battery life.  Disappointed in the USB-C doesn't do video out to the TV.  Very disappointed.  Also three apps that worked well, I enjoyed often, really the primary apps on the Fire HD, don't work (Fox News, Flipp, and Gogo Entertainment).  The Fox News app crashes while reading stories.  Flipp is a great app for looking at store ads.  Gogo Entertainment was primary for watching inflight videos on Alaska Airlines.  Update: Facebook app needs manual update every week and the screen doesn't rotate or size to the sceen. Four apps that don't work.  Only does two things well; stream Amazon Prime and shop Amazon.  Just changing the power port, how the tablet charges, was not necessary unless it provides all the other features of USB-C.  Going to say ""disappointed"" for a third time._x000D_

  This tablet is a very nice tablet for the price.  The main issue I had with it is that Lenovo seemingly does not have Widevine L1 certification.  There seems to be some controversy whether it is Lenovo or Netflix, but the long and short of it is that you will be watching at least those two services in 480P.  I didn't even know this was a thing when I bought the tablet as I watch YouTube primarily and it looks beautiful.  I'm very disappointed that in 2020 there is even this issue.  I understand it's to combat piracy but still...!  If you don't plan on watching those types of streaming services, this is a great tablet!_x000D_

  I tried two other tablets before coming to get this one. I tried both the E10 (which I guess is a cheaper, more economical version of this?) and the M10 HD. This tablet only costs $50 more than the E10 and was the same price as the M10 (from MicroCenter) and it's definitely better than both. It's faster, smoother, and has overall a better user experience cause of it.I personally use it at my restaurant to automate lights, play music, etc. but it would also work great as a casual use tablet as well. The Plus comes with the higher def screen and the octa-core processor which makes it better for casual use. Bang for Buck, this tablet is 10/10._x000D_

  Garbage. Won’t turn on even after letting it charge and following all the instructions. So I searched online for problems with a black screen and device will not turn it on for this particular model and it seems that there are a lot of users who have complained that even after fully charged and a reset, the device never turns on. Well, that is exactly my experience. I purchased this charged it went to turn it on and have never gotten past a fully black screen even after following all of the instructions on the Lenovo website for troubleshooting. I’m used to devices being able to work like Apple products right out of the box. So this is going back to Amazon for a refund and I’m going back to Apple for a device that actually does what it says._x000D_

  After tons of research I bought the Lenovo m10 plus uhd with 4gm ram.You will want to purchase a device with as much ram as you can find!  A lot of tablets currently come in 2gb ram or 3 GB ram.The Lenovo m10 plus uhd that I bought is the 4gb ram variant. At a bare minimum you will want 4gb of ram to operate quickly.I bought the Lenovo m10 plus with 4gb ram because at this Price-point it's a great value!USB-c charging is newer and faster than micro usb charging, 5ghz wifi band is the newest, 1080p screen is amazing, both cameras are excellent at this price, Bluetooth 5.0 is amazing, battery life is great, octo-core cpu is essential, the small black plastic bezels are tiny and the screen is relatively large, and Android 9 provides a ton of functionality!Lenovo seems to be the best bang for your buck!_x000D_

The screen is gorgeous. Same res as last one but looks better. Nice color. The tablet is slightly smaller than the last but the screen is actually bigger. A downside is that without a cover, it's very slippery. Another issue is battery life. Not horrible but the battery should be bigger.  Over all though.

  Nice tablet for the money. I just received this so I haven't checked out everything. So far it looks good I had a little bit trouble connecting to the internet was probably becauseI was too far from my modem. This is my second tablet so I don't have a whole lot to compare it to-and I have no plans right now to buy a 300-$500 tablet, but it seems much nicer then my 7 Kindle which tend to have too much bloatware and uses up too much battery life. I thought this mostly to replace my it which seems to be probably on its last legs after 4yrs. (Ty amazon). The 10 inch screen I bought the $150 10.3 FHD version which fits my needs. so I can't really say a Samsung is better etc. . Had a little trouble getting the time on the clock just right.

  After two weeks of use I can say with certainty that this is a nice little tablet. Running android nine means that it has a very clean and non-crapware installation.The colors are sharp and bright and the ship seems rather peppy. There’s no discernible lag in loading or switching applications.On the downside it is possible for a tablet to be too thin and sensitive. The finish is also extremely smooth. This combination of factors makes the tablet both difficult to hold and difficult to hold onto! To solve this issue I went with the ORANXIN Case for Lenovo M10 Plus - Silicone Soft Skin TPU Shockproof Lightweight Protective Cover for Lenovo M10 Plus TB-X606F/X 10.3 inch Tablet. And my only complaint about it is that I wish it fit slightly tighter.The other issue that stands out is that despite the tablet having a 1920 x 1200 resolution the Netflix app only allows you to look at standard mode. Also if you trying to stream a 1080p movie from your home media server you are going to want to pre-transcode the file for smooth playback. I don’t know if the issue is with the hardware or with the network connection.All in all this tablet gets five stars._x000D_

  MEH - Replacing an aging Asus tablet and liked the specs/price point of this Lenove - but found the battery life unsatisfactory - not convinced it'd even last a long airplane flight. I was getting 4-5 hours out of it with browsing/streaming video. Screen was very clear but a little on the ""cool"" side for me -even after adjustments. Fairly clean Android 9 skin - no problems there. Sturdy build, good feel in the hands, very thin bezels - all good - but the battery life was a deal breaker.

  This tab is an upgrade for us, as our old tab was getting slow. This tab is fast, holds battery charge much longer than previous tabs, has a large screen, HD, plenty of light adjustments, vivid color & good sound. It is thin & lightweight. We love it. Very few covers available just yet but we did find one that encases the tab rather than snaps in. Per usual, it takes time to set up w/the built in features, installing our apps & auto log ins. It is the best tab & we've had many over the years. We have a blue tooth speaker, large TV sound bar & ear buds connected for music, lectures, ebooks, movies, etc. It is great! We use it for work on Microsoft products, all the streaming services, email, photography editing, recipes in the kitchen, in the sewing room, on the patio, e-reading, research, etc.. It is very versatile. We rarely use the laptop anymore. It fits into a purse or tote for errands & travel. It was well packaged & arrived as expected.  It was a great value for features._x000D_

  My usage: Mostly passive consumption and background use during work - YouTube (podcasts, music, some movies for background noise), Audible, Prime Video. Some active tasks during downtime - Kindle, web browsing, N64 and DC emu gaming.What I like:•Solid and quality metal build.•4gb memory/64gb storage•relatively stock/vanilla android experience (not heavily forked)•It will receive Android 10 ~Oct 2020.•Nice screen resolution spec and IPS panelWhat's Okay:•Dual Speakers: Not terrible but nothing spectacular. Good enough for my needs as a lot of the time I used airpods or over the ear bluetooth headphones. What's expected for the budget price.What could have improved:• (Nitpick) The power button placed above the volume rocker would have been more intuitive for me. I kept putting the device to sleep instead of turning the volume down. I still hesitate for a second to check what I'm pressing.• Battery life. I didn't travel that much this year so it wasn't a deal breaker, but 5,000mAh battery is something you'll have  to remember about regular charges. I believe the stand by time would also last less than 3 days if I forgot about the tablet, it would definitely be dead.•GPU: The Power VR 8320 is from 2014 which is pretty dated in tech terms. It doesn't benchmark well so if gaming is something you're into, you might want to consider another option.•(Nitpick) The option for a persistent ""Recent"" task tray icon instead of a swipe up gesture - on stock android, you can enable this, however, Lenovo removed this option.•Netflix, Prime Video, and some other steaming apps, won't render full HD resolution because of WideVine DRM. This might be a huge deal breaker for some people who want to use it for streaming video.Overall: I got this in May and was pleased with the $200 price point and the build. It's a nice little work companion as I don't use a ton of apps, maybe a dozen total. I think if you're not into gaming it will do just fine for you but you might want to consider the Samsung A7 (2020).Pros for Samsung:•Battery: 7,040mAh  vs 5,000mAh•GPU: Adreno 610 (2019) vs PowerVR GE8320 (2014) - significantly higher benchmarks•Quad Speakers vs. Dual Speakers - more powerful, slightly warmer and filling.•Full HD for streaming apps (Netflix, Prime Video, etc)•Possibly more future support/updates/xda developmentI recently got the A7 on sale for $169.95 from Amazon (reg $229 - if it goes back up, wait for a black Friday or holiday deal) for the 3gb ram/32gb storage - though it does have less ram and storage I think a few things make it a possible better option. I haven't noticed any lag difference with 3gb ram for app tasks yet. 've got a regular habit of clearing the app tray unconsciously since the recent app button is there at all times. The 32gb will be supplemented with a microSD card, so storage isn't too much of a worry for my needs. Additionally I usually don't keep any apps around that I don't use. Though the screen size is nearly identical, I don't feel any significant downgrade from the IPS to a TFT, plus, you will get back full HD resolution on video streaming apps, so a TFT @1080p still beats IPS @720p or lower in my eyes.Where I did notice a difference in performance was gaming. The Samsung's Adreno 610 GPU is noticeably faster and smoother than the M10's PowerVR GE8320 as to be expected from a near 5 year difference in age. I noticed this especially in several retro N64 emu games, so I'm glad I did get to test and compare. More than likely, I'll be selling the M10 Plus so somebody else can get use out of it as I don't need two tablets.I was never a huge fan of Samsung's UI from the TouchWiz days as I much prefer a stock Android feel, however, their recent ""One UI"" interface doesn't feel clunky. I am using Nova Launcher just so I can give it more of a vanilla android feel with the icons and home screen features._x000D_

  After recently purchasing a DJI Mavic Mini I was hoping to use my Samsung Tab A to fly the drone. Not possible. After lots of research, I settled on buying this to use with my drone. In order to download the DJI fly app, your tablet must be a 64bit system. You can download the DJI Fly software directly from the play store with this Lenovo M10 plus. Flew my drone using the tablet without any issues. The app functions exactly the same as it does on my phone.

  Spent some time setting this device up today. It seems snappy and quick. The screen is sharp and responsive to touch. We are mounting this with velcro tape to update an older treadmill for streaming entertainment. While installing apps, the battery life went down rather fast compared to our phones. Of course, I had screen on the brightest setting, so YMMV. As I'm leaving it powered all the time on the treadmill, the battery life won't be an issue. I did look at the Vankyo models and found the Lenovo to have more ram, storage, and higher resolution. I also like the Lenovo brand, though everything is made in China. I wish Lenovo would make a 14"" or larger tablet at this price point. 10.3"" is nice, but peloton has shown that there is a market for large panels attached to fitness equipment._x000D_

  Lenovo is very fast and so far after two days, I like it a lot. I doubt if I will ever need more storage space. I love the fact that it has a metal back. It feels substantial and not flimsy in weight. I would recommend this to all. I love android. If you can't afford an Ipad this is next best in my humble opinion._x000D_

  First unit was DOA. The replacement came quickly enough and has been used for a couple months now. My daughter (7yo) is the main user of this tablet. It's working well enough for home schooling thanks to Covid.As we prepare for a trip, I tried to insert a new SD card to load up a couple films to help with entertainment while we're on the road. Well, now the SD card tray isn't coming out.Not all is lost, but, meh, I won't be getting another Lenovo._x000D_

  This was a fine tablet when I fist got it, but it, like so many cheap android tablets slowly becomes more sluggish and non responsive. I got it for reading comics and watching movie, so I have 4 or 5 apps installed, but it's so slow it's basically not usable.You really get what you pay for with android tablets.Save up a little longer and buy something better._x000D_

  This tablet is simply Awesome!  I purchased this Lenovo tablet to replace the Onn tablet that I got from Walmart earlier this year and I've been using it every since.  I actually did my review on this tablet.  Needless to say, I put my Onn tablet back in its original packaging.  This Lenovo tablet is fast enough to easily handle my games and streaming media.  Battery life is great.  This tablet's battery will easily last for hours, even with my streaming internet games.  Touch screen is very responsive and accurate with or without a stylus.  Picture quality is great too.  The value and peace of mind that you receive from purchasing this tablet is ""Priceless""_x000D_

  I use the Lenovo Tab M10 Plus FHD mostly for browsing, emails and some gaming. I bought it specifically because of the 4 GB of RAM and added a 128 GB micro SD, and that's where you will run into an issue with the Lenovo Tab M10 Plus FHD  MicroSD card slot/tray. I had to return the first one as the tray would not eject. When my second one arrived, thank you Amazon, I realized that the key does not cause the tray to eject, as it describes in the instructions, but you have to use the key to pry, very carefully and patiently the SD card slot/ tray loose. This is not easy and it is the main reason I returned the first one as I did not figure out what the issue was until the second one arrived. It is not easy to ""very carefully"" remove the MicroSD card slot/tray. So if you need the added external memory, this will be an issue for you. And the battery life is so-so or average with the quality overall being pretty high these two issues cause me to rate the tablet 4 stars._x000D_

  Hardware is great.But Android is so stripped down it's frankly hard to use.  You have to get apps for almost everything.  Oh yes, it comes with some google apps and a few other things, but not much.  And then you have to sort thru the apps from the play store that have ads in them or have privacy concerns, or are ways to rip off your credit card.  Even most of the file browsers have ads in them!  I mean you would think that you would get a simple file browser in peace.  Yes, there is a google file browser preinstalled, but it's got its own privacy issue in that it came from Google which is mining most of what we do with AI for some time.  I just want a simple notebook that gives us our privacy back, and I don't feel like it's harvesting me in some way at every turn of the screw.  Next time I'm going to go looking for a true open source Linux machine, that runs something like Ubuntu._x000D_

  this is my fourth Lenovo tablet no I didn't buy a fourth one because the others broke I bought this one because it is the newest version of the Lenovo tablets and it does not disappoint. My first 3 Lenovo tablets were over 2 years old and they were dated but they still work fine but I sold them. They had the older Android or there so they could not update anymore. I had this tablet now for about 5 days and I have been using it every day it is beautiful very easy to work with very thin in very expandable with a SD card. I am adding a 256 gigabyte SD card to it so I can add more music to it. Plenty of room for all of your apps your Netflix Hulu plus HBO Max whatever you want to put on here you can add to it you like playing video games go for it you can download tons of games to it as well. This is a very easy tablet to carry around it is very thin so I would say get a carrying case for it throw it in your backpack and you are good to go._x000D_

  Love it. My only concern is it linked to my Moto Z2 Force. I'm going to call Lenovo to see if I can factory reset it and will it stand alone without linking to my phone. I understand I could put a sim card in it from my carrier and also use it as a phone, but I don't want to  I will put an SD card in it for more storage. So far it's just like having a larger version of my smartphone. I'll see if linking it to my laptop with windows 10 would work. I really wanted a tablet just to replace my aging HP laptop. May have to get a new display for the laptop and let my wife have the tablet. Just have to play around with the tablet for awhile and see.Really like the aluminum frame and once I get a Surface type display case maybe with the backlit keyboard it might be a better setup. Would really love a Surface pro but have to be rich to afford it._x000D_

  This is already a cheap, bottom of the line tablet so I wasn't expecting much, however, I was still somehow disappointed.The battery life is nowhere near advertised. It ran dry in about 4 hours of just basic web surfing and such.Usually, even cheap devices will be fast at the start when not loaded up with apps but not this. Insane lag, unresponsive, basic apps like Settings will crash, pretty much unusablePiece of junk that not even the kids will enjoy. Save for a more expensive tablet_x000D_

  This is a great and inexpensive tablet. The overall quality is so much better than tablets at this price and much more expensive. The only reason I can't give it a 5 star is because the battery life sucks. I'm not a gamer or watch a lot of videos all day long. If you are this is not the tablet for you.

  When Covid struck, I did a lot more work from home and it was a hassle to print things. However, I still needed to look at a lot of documents. I had another tablet bit it was a 7-inch tablet and it was hard to read documents. I decided to get a 10-inch tablet. I was thinking about an Amazon Fire tablet which is a beautiful device too. I had previously had Lenovos and I wanted to try this one because it is Android which allows for a few apps I need that you can't get with Kindle. I ordered this tablet with the case that is recommended. It came fairly quickly although they seems to be popular and a bit hard to get sometimes.So far I love this tablet. I will start by saying it is not super fast, so if you are looking for a high-powered device, this may not be the best choice. I have found it to be lightweight, solid and very usable. It was super easy to set up and it works well. I can easily read documents. It's easy to carry around too so I just take it with me when I do go into work. I have also discovered that it works really nice for streaming video. My new cable is set up to stream TV. I have been just using the tablet to stream things. It gives a great picture and seems to be pretty glitch free.If you are looking for a basic tablet that is big enough to read documents and you are just a basic user, it's hard to go wrong with this tablet. It is affordable. It is high-quality. It appears to be reliable._x000D_

  This thing is awesome! Well worth the money. I'd say it's slightly faster than my iPad (I got the 8 core, 4GB RAM, and 64GB storage version of the M10 FHD Plus). The screen is amazing. There's no lag, and I've done some be pretty heavy workloads on it just to test it out. Large spreadsheets in Excel, large PowerPoints, no problem. I love the widescreen format for watching movies, and the audio with FLAC files is excellent. Highly recommend this. I would definitely but this again. I was going to buy one of the Fires, but the specs on this we're better and you get the full Play app store without having to sideload it (and even when you sideload the Play store on a Fire, some apps just aren't available or compatible)._x000D_

Touch screen is slow to respond it gets stuck processing and needs a hard-reboot all the time.

  I've been looking to replace an aging laptop for some time now, and a tablet seemed like a better fit since I mostly used it for media. I had several requests:1. 128 GB of storage with micro SD expansion slot2.  4 GB of RAM3. 10 inch screen4. Headphone jack5. USB type C connector6. No more than $3007. Name brand8. Android 10This tablet fulfills all but the last request, it runs Android 9 out of the box, but from my understanding, it's likely to get an update to Android 10 at some point. I'm not sure why such a recent tablet doesn't ship with the latest version of the OS, but this is hardly an issue unique to this tablet.So what do I think? Well, I'm mostly impressed. Let's start with the good. As I stated in the title, this is a great bang for the buck in terms of specs. You'll see a lot of brand new tablets that are 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage. Granted, they're in the $150 price range, but those are pretty bottom of the barrel specs, even for a mobile device. Even the standard iPad only has 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage and it costs $330.The screen is a highlight, the color and brightness are impressive. The resolution is 1920x1200, so it's slightly better than 1080p. Videos and games really pop. It's not going to compete with OLED, but it's one of the best parts of the tablet.In the audio department, it's pretty standard fare, the speakers don't sound fantastic, but they are well placed on either end of the tablet so it sounds more organic. I'm pleased to report that there is a headphone jack for those who are so inclined (an increasingly rare feature in phones and tablets) as well as support for Bluetooth 5.0.As far as performance is concerned, it's good. The 4 GB of RAM means programs can run in the background and not bog the tablet down, which makes it a great device for multimedia. The menus and apps felt responsive, not buttery smooth, but I didn't encounter any performance issues for media/apps. It doesn't fare as well in the gaming department, but it ran everything I threw at it. My only gripe is Call of Duty Mobile stuck the graphics on the low setting.In terms of build quality, it's quite impressive. The materials feel premium with good haptics, the body is metal and it seems like it would hold up even if dropped.Now for the the negatives, I found the cameras to be sub par. There's a 8 MP rear camera and a 5 MP front camera, the overall image is soft. Those are far from impressive in 2020. The video camera is similarly fuzzy as it only supports 720p and 1080p, there's not even a 60 FPS mode. More light does yield better results, just keep your expectations in check.While I am glad the tablet uses USB C (which should be the universal standard across the board) however, it does not support fast charging. This means you while charge the device while using it, it won't be able to keep pace. While it will gain a charge with the screen off, it's painfully slow  You have to turn the tablet completely off to give it a proper charge.I have other smaller gripes such as Netflix only running in 480p (which, from my understanding, is an issue between Lenovo and Netflix), the Lenovo overlay (which can be mostly negated), and the less than perfect battery life, but these are getting into nitpicks at this point. Overall, I am very satisfied with the tablet, there are some cut corners, that is somewhat to be expected at this price point. I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a mid-range tablet at a great price._x000D_

  The tablet seems nice.  It feels solid, performance seems good and overall, I was initially pleased.  When I tried to run Netflix (not a primary function for me), it needed an update.  The Play store would not allow it to update for compatibility.  I tried downloading the apk from Netflix and installing, but that gave a compatibility error at runtime.  I tried to reach out to Lenovo to see if it was something they would address.  I could certainly live with it for a bit.  Contacting Lenovo was a fruitless effort.  As a result, I am returning this, because I have no confidence that there won't be other compatibility issues, but I am completely confident that Lenovo will NOT provide any support.  My biggest complaint about the tablet was actually only Lenovo's complete lack of support.  The actual issue may have been resolvable, but I'll never know since Lenovo does not provide real support.  I would say, if watching Netflix is a must for you, avoid this tablet._x000D_

  Well I should have listened to the bad reviews! So slow that it was hard to enter my pattern to unlock it because it would time out before it would display it.  When the screen would rotate it would stop half way and sit there for 2-3 seconds displaying half the screen.  there was a 2-3 second or longer lag after touching the screen.  Once I got the browser open, I never could browse with it.  I could barely get an app to open. I am shocked that Lenovo has released such an awful tablet.

  I needed to replace a 4 yrs old Asus Android tablet. The old Asus tablet had stereo speakers and a great colorful display. I wasn't willing to spend $600 to $900 for a Samsung. After much research, this Lenovo seemed to add up to being an excellent Android tablet without breaking the Bank.Performance is excellent. It is snappy and smooth. Many action and first person games I play on my phone play quite well on the tablet. With this tablet having 4GB of RAM memory that would attribute to the great performance. I purchased the 64GB storage so there is plenty of room for whatever I should store. I added 128 GB of extra storage by inserting a microSD card.The pictures and description are dead on about this excellent Android tablet. The display is bright and colorful. The display colors actually are very accurate and vibrant. The adaptive brightness is a plus for the user.Sound-wise, it has excellent speakers that you would find on higher-end tablets. Sound reproduction is something I would expect to find on a higher-end tablet. It has stereo speakers that are located on the left and right sides of the tablet case.The camera is typical of any Android tablet, not that great. Video is about the same as any Android tablet I've ever used, also not that great but definitely usable for video calls. The microphone for video calls actually is pretty good.Tablet quality is very high-end. The case itself is slightly thinner then others I have looked at or handled in stores.Everything you see in the pictures and item description is what you get when you open the box. I am very happy with this tablet. I recommend this tablet._x000D_

  Probably like many Android users, I have owned several tabs over the last several years - some even at the same time!  The reason is that either they do not get updated as they should be from the Manufacturer, they get laggy, or that some particular pain spot in it's design or specs keep it from becoming that ""it"" device.It happened to me recently.  I recently purchased a Vankyo  MatrixPad S30 - price was right and I actually liked and used it for a week or so.  That is until when searching on Amazon, I stumbled upon this Lenovo.  I immediately had buyers remorse as for $10 more ($199) I could have had a name brand tab, with 4GB Ram+64GB storage (the former is key for me) instead of one of the countless budget Chinese built tablets  Do not get me wrong - the S30 is a great device as well for the money - but not when you can compare it to a budget device like this with better specs, probably support and at a similar price point.The M10 Plus has an excellent build quality - very solid.  Screen is very nice (great resolution in this price range), and it exhibits no lag for what I use it for at all.The screen bezels are very thin.  Now most reviewers rave about this nowadays when it comes to laptops and tabs, but in this case, it makes it a bit tricky to hold.  So I remedied by buying a nice foilo style case (search for KuRoKo Lenovo Tab M10 Plus 10.3 Smart Case, Slim Light Cover Trifold Stand Hard Shell Case for 10.3 inch Lenovo Tab M10 Plus ZA5T0263US (Black)) which makes it easy to hold and which adds very little bulk (and most importantly - doesn't cover these beautifully thin bezels!I am very pleased, and for this price point, this tab knocks it out of the park!_x000D_

  Was looking for good value, reliable product, recent ANDROID support, decent performance all in package that wouldn't break the bank.  I have kiddos and the tablets will be dropped so investing $$ for latest/greatest Pixel, Samsung, or Apple product is ridiculous.The $200 price point for the Lenovo M10 Plus tablet is great.  I've been using for 1.5 weeks with no issues.I bought the M10+ at same time with Vankyo Matrixpad S30.  The S30 is dedicated for kiddos with remote learning this Fall.  The M10+ is for my use.The $50 price difference for M10+ gets you: - much more recent security level updates for ANDROID9.  The Vankyo is still Oct 2019 (!!!). - M10+ slightly thinner and and looks/feels more refined. - M10+ has external contacts for base charge/display station. - M10+ has many more options for cases, brands, colors, styles.  Vankyo has basically TWO cover options -- rugged or foldable case._x000D_

  This tablet is defective. I bought this on August 22 for my son. He got home from his dad’s house on August 25th. When I tried to turn the tablet on it would not turn on. So I charged it. No matter how long I charge it it will not turn on. This is a brand new tablet! So I googled it. And it turns out this is a problem that many Lenovo tablets have. If you let them die or run out of battery they won’t turn back on. You’ll have open it up and do some taking apart to get it to turn back on which is a lot of work I did not sign up for. I paid $160 something for this tablet. I shouldn’t have to take it apart to get it to work. I’m returning this. Thank God it’s only been 3 days so Amazon let’s me return it.

  As of June 20th 2020. Works great but like most Android Devices expect it to take time to restore and update it's software. According to it's sticker, my tablet is about 2 months old. This tablets weight was something I wanted as it fella so sturdy. This will mostly serve to compliment my ASUS Laptop as I attend college. I don't think this Tablet will WOW anyone for hardcore gaming but for things like running an eBay Store, browsing the web, reading books, or even taking pictures at 8 MP, it's perfectly fine. Always get some type of carrying case. The screen is very nice and bright. It's Bluetooth 5.0 and 5Ghz Wifi is excellent. Many options for battery life, night time modes, screen dimming, Dolby Audio, and there is an official Lenovo Keyboard accessory for it too. The speakers sound excellent and no problems with it's headphone jack placement. The camera is actually pretty good at 8MP but like most smartdevices don't expect much from front facing camera.I will try to update and add notes as the years go on._x000D_

  The one i received had display issues...the one i received had a dull screen in it's background white values...far from ""paper white"" which for me was caused contrast and text reading difficulties. Shame, because colors, pics, and vids are brilliant as I don't notice the grey against a strong color ok f display. I was not able to adjust any of the multiple settings to overcome the text issues. Further, bolding text and brightening in settings caused slightly bizzare effects and rapidly used battery much more than expected, although I can't qualify the latter battery issue with a bench test value.Otherwise, I was impressed by the pad and its build and qualities for this price point.  Ultimately, I had to return it....wondering if I got a sub optimal display or they are all shipped this way.

  Sprung for the 64/4 gig instead of the 32/2.  Probably overkill for my needs, but not too much of a price difference when I was looking at them.  Nothing comparable in the same price range.Pros: Great screen.  Fast processor.  Plenty of memory.  Sound is pretty good (2 speakers).  Starts up in <30 seconds from being totally off.  Start up with facial recognition in just a couple of seconds.  Mutliple apps running at the same time didn't cause any hesitation or lag.Meh: Battery 5k mah.  Lenova, why not put in a 7k mah????  That said, I've cycled down to 30% or so and fully charged about 5 or 6 times now.  It'll run about 12 hours down to 30%, but I'm just surfing and playing simple games.  If you're using for video or playing games that use a lot of processing, you might want to proceed with caution.Cons: Love the idea of narrow bezels, but between that and the slim design and relatively slick back and weight, I had to get a case for it.  I don't normally use a case, but I had to for this one, and it made a world of difference._x000D_

  I was on my third replacement Fire 10"" tablet and the same issue started happening again. I wanted no part of a 4th replacement so I decided to get this Lenovo M10 Plus. It was a recent release, had good specs and the price was comparable with the latest Fire 10"" (that I had NO intention of even considering). One big selling point was in the Amazon description which stated ""Throw in seamless Qualcomm Snapdragon octa-core processing. . ."" Imagine my surprise on getting the tablet running CPU-Z and discovering it does not have a Qualcomm processor. CPU-Z reports a Cortex A-53, Lenovo's website says (as does the system information) that it has a Media Tek Helio P22T. This didn't make me happy. Trying to contact Lenovo made me even less happy.But. . . I needed a tablet, I have a tablet, I'm going to keep it. Simple as that.It does have a really sharp and clear screen. Color reproduction matches my laptop pretty well. I like the side firing stereo speakers. The remind me of my old Samsung 10"" tablet that had speakers in the bezel that were aimed at your face. These are a close second. The Dolby Atmos controls take a while to tweak but sound reproduction is above average. I'm a little disappointed at how restrictive Lenovo is with Android 9. My settings menu, even with developer options turned on, I look like a strict business product that the corporation doesn't want the employees messing around in.Performance is ok, this isn't a gaming rig and it shows. I tried Castle Wreck which I play on my Galaxy S9 phone and it ran, horribly, but it didn't crash. But again, I needed a tablet because I'm disabled and spend a lot of time flat on my back. I watch videos from several sources, surf the web and my casual games, cribbage, backgammon, etc. run fine.I had to get a case for it. The tablet screen is slightly bigger 10.3"" vs my old Fire's 10.1"" but the tablet itself is significantly smaller than the Fire. It's thinner, lighter and the bezels are almost non-existent. That, plus the incredibly slick aluminum back made holding the tablet while laying down difficult to say the least. Found an affordable 3rd party cover that does what I needed.All in all? The screen is stunning. It runs everything I need it to though not all I wish it would. Price was right and it had a full year warranty. It'll do._x000D_

  I really wanted this tablet for 2 things: reading digital books and playing games.For digital books, this is a dream.  I really like the screen brightness, light hues, and grayscale options.  Those are fantastic!When I try to play simple games found in the Google store, one of which is a VERY common game even advertised on TV, gameplay lags.  Most of the time that is not an issue, but in one of my games, timing is a crucial element of the game.  That is a disappointment.  I expected this to be faster than that or at least on par with a phone that is now 4 years old.Another thing that bothers me is if you are not looking straight on at the screen, the brightness appears much dimmer making anything, even reading at an angle a little more difficult.For the money, this is a good tablet.  It's great with web browsing and video streaming, has a left and right channel for sound, has BlueTooth, has the ability to have mobile access if you have an account for that, connects quickly to wireless internet networks, has long battery life and it has easy to use controls.  I don't really care for the layout of all the applications and wish I could set it up more like my Android phone.  That could be my own ignorance and I may come across a wiki or blog that tells me how to do that to my liking._x000D_

  4 meg RAM, 64GB storage, perhaps will get Android 10.  At this price it's great.  I use it mostly for reading, web browsing, and as a terminal for MoodeAudio.  This is a tablet, which means it is not a general purpose computing device.  Using a tablet for ""productivity"" or ""content creation"" is like trying to be a cabinet maker using only a hammer and chisel.  This is good at what it's really designed to do.  If you have a good wifi signal you can stream video or play it from a network source easily.  The 1080p display is decent, not as good as its predecessor's 2K display but considering the current price of Android 2K displays it's a very good compromise.  Sadly, it looks like most vendors aren't making good Android tablets any more.  The ASUS tablet I replaced (broke the screen) cost more, had a 2K display, aptX Bluetooth, and cost half again as much as this one.  This has twice the RAM and twice the storage.If you want a relatively inexpensive tablet with a decent display, bluetooth 5 (no aptX), a more than minimal amount of RAM, this is definitely one to consider.  Its aspect ratio makes it narrower than some tablets with the same diagonal measurement.  It's easier for me to pick up with one hand.  Its predecessor was just at the edge of possibility.  All in all I'm pleased.  I got more than I wanted for what I spent.  An ipad would be better, but not 3 times better by a long stretch._x000D_

  There is a lot of things to like about this tablet, the metal body is great, the stereo speakers are also very good. The battery life is above average and the screen is IPS full HD....but one for me, major flaw is lack of HD on Netflix.....apparently it has something to do with the DMR security thing...my fault for not looking it up before buying...oh well, somehow the shows on netflix still look nice in SD playback but having a FULL HD screen and being forced to watch in SD is trash. If watching netflix is a major part of your daily use, look for another tablet that can support HD playback. Otherwise this is a pretty good tablet._x000D_

  The tablet has been great, it is quick, the touch screen seems good, and the battery life is pretty nice.Pros:1) The screen is good2) It seems pretty snappy, apps open and run well3) The sound is fine, it isn't amazing but it's better than a lot of tablets I've used4) The camera is pretty good, the front facing does a good job with video calls and I did take a couple pictures with the rear facing one and they were fine, not on par with my phone but that is expectedCons:1) No HD content in Netflix, this seems to be a software limitation that they could get fixed but haven't and from reading their support forums it doesn't seem likely it will be fixed anytime soonThe tablet is capable of full HD but not with Netflix, YouTube is fine so it isn't a hardware limitation but rather a software one.  I've done a bit of research on this and it honestly seems like an issue between Lenovo and Netflix so there is some hope of it eventually getting fixed but given the response from Lenovo on their forums (essentially none) it may be a while._x000D_

  I had to buy two tablets, one for each of my kids so they can attend to their ""online school"". I bought this Lenovo because it was one of the cheapest options with its technical characteristics (HD and RAM) and it is a good known brand (Lenovo). Along with this tablet I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 with the same technical specs, I bought the Samsung because I had a coupon from American Express which saved me 50 dollars on the Samsung purchase and I bought the Lenovo because I had some ThankYou points that I could use on Amazon. Basically the ""only difference"" between the Samsung and this Lenovo, is the brand. I put 3 stars on the Lenovo because it is much slower, it freezes while running google meet and the Samsung doesnt do that even do they are practically the same in terms of technical specs. The Samsung runs very smooth and the camera quality is much better (pictures look nicer)_x000D_

  I ordered the Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020). The tablet looks and feels great and I thought I got a really good deal -- it's much less expensive than an iPad or other tablets.However, this tablet is NOT GOOD FOR STREAMING VIDEO. Specifically the YouTube TV app -- the app would load and sound would play, but no video. After some research, I found that this was a common problem with this tablet across different streaming apps. For me, that was a dealbreaker.For the record, all of my software was up to date, wi-fi signal was good and I tried all of the usual restart, reinstall etc. tactics. I suspect it is a software issue on Lenovo's end.If you don't plan to stream video, this tablet seems great. However, if you are like most people and want to stream video ... look elsewhere or at least check to see if Lenovo has fixed the issue._x000D_

  I got this tablet for my 3 year old because her Samsung tab E was getting old and running slow. This was less expensive than Samsung so I decided to give it a try. It’s wonderful! I have no complaints. It’s super fast and the screen is amazing. I’m not super tech savvy but I do have an expensive new Samsung tablet and apple laptop for myself. Honestly this tablet is every bit as good as my more expensive Samsung one! I wish I would’ve known. We are getting this tablet for our other kids now. You get a lot of bang for your buck!_x000D_

  Pros:* Video quality is crisp.* Sound is wonderful sounding.* It is quite fast.* Has metal backing plate and a nice feeling touch screen.Cons:* It lacks widevine support. (No netflix, despite netflix being featured in the icons of the product picture)* Rooting is impossible due to overzealous protection code.* Productivity mode is buggy. If you want to drag icons around you best be quick or it will pretend you dropped the icon.* WiFi occasionally will just stop working until it is turned off and back on.I had bought this as a replacement for my Lenovo Tab 4(tb-x304f) after the battery had gone bad. My experience with it was wonderful, and I would have the same experience with the Lenovo M10. Unfortunately this was not the case.While it is great for watching YouTube, Browsing the web, and what not, the lack of Widevine support in the processor is a massive let down because a lot of media providers such as netflix rely on Widevine to encrypt/decrypt content.The WiFi dropping out is also a irritant. While it is recoverable, It shouldn't be needed to restart the wifi connection.Rooting is impossible, the MediaTek processor refuses to boot any unsigned firmware, which is needed for app development.Overall, I would say 2/5. For what the tablet can do, it is great. But it lacks some critical stuff and has some software bugs.Perhaps Lenovo can fix these in a firmware update, but my experience with Lenovo Updates is they don't update often._x000D_

  It is an inexpensive tablet and it is just what I ordered.  What was not obvious when reviewing it before buying is that this is a cut down version of Android.  I have a $200 Samsung phone and I have this $250 tablet.  If I hook the phone to my Lenovo PC, I can see the contents of the drives, internal and SD.  If I hook this tablet to my PC, nothing.  Not even the SD.  So my cheaper than this tablet phone has a much better Android OS. There is no reason for this.  There's more but space is limited.  So far all my streaming Applications work, Prime, Netflix, PBS, etc. but the Android OS is very poor and so I have to say that I don't recommend you even consider this.  There was NO reason to force a downgraded version of Android._x000D_

  Struggles to run any sort of app that needs a decent amount of processing power (i.e games and surprisingly enough, file management).Effectively closes all other apps when they're not active. This means that if you tab out of your browser app, tabbing back into it will require you to log back into to websites, re-fill forms, etc. Extremely annoying and unnecessary.USB link with a computer is unresponsive at best, duplicates files at worst. Using it with a Windows 10 desktop, and tablet will always either hide it's internal storage, never show up, randomly disconnect itself after moving files around. Trying to mount an internal SD card makes these problems even more frequent, somehow.Absolutely awful ""derivative"" Android settings menu. This looks and feels like an Android OS, but everything is just not where you expect it to be, and some settings *just don't work* (i.e automatic brightness will decide when it will work, and when it'll just keep the brightness at full blast, actual time be dammed).Heinous permissions issues with common apps. Twilight screen dimmer only seems to work half the time as the system constantly denies permission to dim and color shift the screen. WinRAR is permanently blocked from having storage access, and can never delete files, only create and extract them. App Store installation will constantly complain about ""running out of space"" when updating apps, requiring full re-installs.Poor audio quality and static when using the 3MM headphone jack. Constant crackling and distortion if the base volume is set too low, or if the tablet is under performance stress.It's an $150 dollar tablet, I guess. You get what you pay for._x000D_

  I have had a windows 10 tablet and I like android as I have an android phone. I used to buy laptops a long time ago from the company now known as Lenovo but was once IBM. The computers never broke on you. Now back to the tablet. The screen is far better than any tablet I have seen. And I am a computer tech. Second the speed is good. Third the battery last for about 3 days full charge depending on use. Now I don't play games so I don't know how long that would last on a charge. But surfing and emails and playing HD videos it last a long time. I love this tablet. My wife has a Galaxy Tab 10A and it blows her tablet out of the water. From pictures to video to the screen resolution and speed it's not even close. I see now I have to buy her one because she was not happy when she seen that LOL! Any way one thing that can be done is customizations where you can do more with the tablet. It's simple and not much to change on the tablet. But besides that man this tablet is so smooth and clear my goodness. Makes looking at videos better than looking at TV and I have 4k video. But the clarity of that screen is amazing and smooth. Downloading apps from google was a breeze. I had one issue with one app and that was Experian but I just went on the browser and done it that way. I also like that google has Microsoft Edge new browser that thing takes google chrome and make it look stupid !! I never thought I would like another windows browser ever because of chrome but I lied. Google better step up because Microsoft Edge is a beast!! With that as my browser it feels like a windows computer but yet it's android. Man I am loving this tablet. You can't go wrong people. I haven't found anything to say I hate this for what I use it for. The cameras are good. I haven't taken pictures with them yet but far as how it looks and the video looks when using the camera it's great! I don't use a tablet for those things but far as I can see pictures will be very nice on that tablet that is a bonus. And you can video stream far as zoom and any other camera streaming app. It's clear and works well. If you want a tablet this one is the real deal. As far as tablets I call this the #1 Killer to all tablets out there. Benchmarks I don't get into if you looking for that  it ranks pretty decent. But I don't get into that because I don't use that to it's full potential for what I need it for. Gamers can use this but I am not a gamer. But playing games work on this tablet and works well and flawless. I have the 4gb and 64gb model. And for $199 man that's stealing !!! Well enjoy people if you buy this tablet you will love it._x000D_

  I'll update as time goes by.(Picture: from left to right- Samsung Tab S2, 1st Gen Apple Tablet, and Lenovo M10 Plus)This is an impressive tablet! The 10.3"" screen can compete with a small laptop. Screen images look amazing. The screen is also bright, even when outside (brightness will have to be set to max outside). However, while the speakers are loud, do not expect them to be booming loud even with Dolby Atmos.I bought this tablet to replace my 10 year old 1st Gen Apple Tablet.I've paired this tablet with KuRoKo Lenovo Tab M10 Plus 10.3 Smart Case, for now. The selections for cases is small, as the tablet is still very new to the marketbas of this writing. But, it will get the job done of protecting your tablet.I can confirm that this tablet does accept microSD cards up to 256gb. Tablet can also format the cards with either Fat32 or ExFat formats. A great feature since most tablets and phones only allow you to just format with no choice or indication as to what they are formatting to (hint: mostly ExFat). I recommend ExFat as some movies in full 1080p can exceed the 4gb single file size limit of Fat32. But that's up to your needs.6-2-2020Been using this as a media player. Tablet does not come with a media player app installed. But, out of the box, Photos can play videos such as mp4 up to 1080p with no issues but limited player options such as play and pause.. Later on I installed VLC player and have been using that for music and movies since. I'll give sketching a try once I pick a pen to use, there's so many to choose from.6-18-2020Sketching on this tablet has been a great experience. You don't need a Bluetooth type pen. Just a touch one with the little circular piece on the touch side. The sketching app on the other hand will be different as there are many to choose from._x000D_

  I just received my tablet yesterday and setting it up was a breeze. It came three (3) days earlier than originally scheduled. I have had a number of tablets and have been with android from the beginning. I own a Samsung S8 plus and a Samsung A50. I still have a Samsung Tab S 8.4 from when they first came out 5 years ago and it is still going. I usually keep my techs for a while and finally decided it was time to get a new tablet. Having used Android Pie on both phones, the Tab S had become woefully outdated and it hurt me to retire it. I began looking for a new tablet. As most know, the Tab S was a top of the line tablet and very pricey. The new S model can cost around $700. After exploring my options, I decided that this tablet might suit my purposes for a lot less and I was not disappointed. The screen is beautiful, the OS is smooth as silk, and I could not be happier. I have owned several Lenovo laptops and they also did not disappoint. I generally use my tab for surfing the internet, Youtube, checking my emails, etc. I do not game at all.

  When I  bought this tablet, I expected performance on the order of other tablets on the market, or phones, running Android.  I am disappointed to say that this device is extremely laggy.  For example, I stream a lot of content over the YouTube app.  Minimizing/maximizing the video seems to take 3 or 4 seconds for the system to process swipes to do so (something that is instantaneous on my phone, which has considerably less processing power than this tablet).

  I bought two of these tablets. The picture quality is crisp and clear. It has a 1080p display but you can only watch Netflix in standard definition. It has to do with Netflix not Lenovo. This tablet has double tap to wake the screen like my LG phone. It also has a feature where if you pick up your tablet up it wakes up the screen. My case did wake the screen and turn the screen off when I closed or open the case but it doesn't anymore. It has a octa core processor and 2gb of ram. It can hold a micro SD card up to 256gb. It's running off android 9 (pie). There is a charging light that's red when charging and turns green when done charging. You can customize the home buttons and also the keyboard. You can have a different color keyboard or have a picture in it. You can also customize the height of the keyboard. Did I mention that this tablet has Dolby Atmos? It has two speakers and you can set the surround sound to movies, music etc. Which it optimizes the sound depending on movies, music or whatever you're doing on your tablet. It makes it sound better.

  For the price, this thing is amazing!I'm coming from a 2 year old Samsung that was about the same price when new.This Lenovo is very fast, and can run several apps at once without serious performance degradation.The ""Productivity mode"" is great, and uses a few of the better concepts of MS Windows or Mac OS.The display actually occupies the entire front of the unit, unlike most mid-priced Android tablets, which have this huge wasted space in a bezel around the edge.The two major drawbacks are audio and expansion.Audio:This tablet sounds *awesome*.The problem is that max volume is way too low. Even connecting to an external BT speaker, it's barely loud enough to overcome my bathroom exhaust fan and shower water. My phone can do that without a speaker...Expansion:I have a USB-C dock with ethernet, HDMI output, USB ports, and SD card readers. This tablet refuses to recognize anything except the charging power pass-through. My USB-C phone recognizes everything on the dock with no problem, in fact, I needed to email dashcam video from the side of the road last week, and would have much rather used the big tablet display to do so, but instead had to use the itty bitty phone display because the phone works with the dock.The tablet DOES work with Windows when plugged into a PC with a USB cable. Mass storage mode, for file management.If they can release firmware that supports a dock or USB expansion (for mouse/keyboard/ethernet/SD reader, etc), I'll knock this thing up to 5 stars and overlook the audio annoyance.One minor drawback:""Tap to wake"" doesn't work after after a few seconds. If the display shuts off, I can double-tap it within a few seconds and it wakes back up. Any longer than that, and I have to hit the lock button to wake it. Settings...been there done that. Not a big deal, just a PITA when I have it parked on a stand and try to use just one hand.Update 9/26/20:Battery life is not good.Wifi is not stable.Battery:I took it off a charger at the office at 100% 23 hours ago, currently at 89% with zero usage (took it off the charger, closed the cover, and dropped it in my bag; just looked at battery now out of curiosity).If I forget to charge it and it's at 20% or less, I can't start a Teams call on it.Wifi:It will arbitrarily drop bandwidth and then connection entirely, but then reconnect ok.Imagine this; you're on a Teams call, and suddenly everyone freezes. Then they come back and Teams asks, ""Bandwidth low, do you want to turn off video?"" Then a few minutes later, the call freezes again, and you pull down status to find wifi disconnected.This isn't so bad when watching a movie or doing work that doesn't need real-time connection, but quite disruptive to live collaboration calls.It happens on all wifi networks while other devices on the same networks see no disruption.If I wasn't past the return deadline, I'd consider returning it based on these flaws. It would be a lifesaver if I could plug in the USB-c dock and use GB ethernet, but I'm not hopefull that will ever come.

  Loved my lenovo tablet/reader UNTIL I opened ""KIDS MODE"" thinking I would teach my granddaughter her colors. KID'S MODE took complete control of my tablet. Cannot close, cannot use ANY other feature.Defaults to KIDS MODE. Granddaughter thinks it's great. I am an 80 yr old AVID READER and haven't been able to access it for three days. Lenovo support is like my tablet~unresponsive!Do not sell another tablet with KIDS MODE on it or WARN PEOPLE. IT CANNOT BE DELETED, CHANGED OR TURNED OFF. IT IS TOTALLY USELESS NOW THAT GRANDDAUGHTER HAS GONE HOME!_x000D_

  The Lenovo tablets I've had (4 over the years) work well, have a small amount of bloat, and have a GPS that does not require WiFi to work. Unfortunately they do not have a compass. This one seems the same.The M10 FHD Plus is no different. if your app requires a compass, like some astronomy apps, then you may want to look elsewhere.According to Lenovo's site the M10, and M8, will be updated to Android 10 this year; it already has 9 (Pie).One star was removed because of Lenovo's service. I bought an M8 on Lenovo's site a few months ago and am still waiting for reimbursement on a price match. Two days after my order their price dropped $20 so I contacted Lenovo to get a price match (30 day guarantee on their site). After countless e-mails and calls I'm still waiting on the reimbursement. fwiw - Since ordering I saw their M8 tablet go through several different promos on their site (e.g. $139, $129, $119) up, down, and up again within days/a week of each other.Last month, October, I bought the M10 FHD Plus on sale from Amazon and received it in record time.Bottom line - unless you need a compass the M10 FHD Plus tablet works great. I would not rely on Lenovo customer service, maybe their tech support is better.Stay safe & Cheers!_x000D_

  Extremely pleased with this affordable +10"" tabled. I've had several tablets in this class and this is by far the best one. It has a zippy processor and the display is vivid and crisp. If I had one critique it would be the screen brightness. At 100%, it's noticably dimmer than my previous Samsung E. But I never run tablets on 100% brightness so I could really care less. Outstanding tablet made even better by the price point._x000D_

It was hard to hold in my hand without my hand getting tired (im 45 and have big hands).. also the aluminum casing is nice but it is slippery.. it will slide all out of your hands.

  I ordered this product for the lightweight which makes it easy to travel while having the power of a laptop. I will start with what I like. I bought this with the keyboard and pen. I have never had a device with a pen that you can use to write on the screen before. Which the pen is really handy for writing notes in meeting at school and classes. The keyboard works really well also and must be magnetic because it snaps right on and holds it in place really well.Now as the headline says the issues. When I got the device I had trouble setting it up for the first time. The device would get stuck in a loop of automatic repair and turning itself off. Which I almost returned the device but then I tried doing a total reinstall of windows 10 to get it to stop and the device has been fine after that. I pretty much only use this device at school and work doing school work and streaming videos. Now after a few months of use, this device has started to shut itself off for no reason and it does get aggravating when working on homework or watching a movie and the device keeps shutting off. This happens at random where it might do it every few mins to every couple hours or work fine and not do it. So because of this, it does seem that this device could be unstable so I could not recommend this product to others.Update: Now 3 months after my purchase this surface go has become a very expensive paperweight. It continually crashes so bad that you can't use it and likes to get stuck in the loop I mentioned before. I changed my rating to one star because that is the lowest I can rate it. This would have been perfect for what I wanted to use it for and I so wish it worked but it is just junk and a bunch of money thrown away. Do not buy this stay away._x000D_

  This is what i always wanted, something small and compact that i can carry around when i go traveling or use in a hotel.I really like the Microsoft Hello that let you unlock or log in windows with your face, it really quick, it takes like 1 second or  less to recognize you.  This surface only has a USB-C port which i like it alot, just get a USB-C hub and you can connect anything to it like HDMI to TV,  use wired internet, or connect your other USB devices to it.  You can also charge your surface with USB-C, no need to carry an extra cable, just use the same USB-C cable as your samsung galaxy phone.It preinstall with Windows Home-S which only let you install apps or programs from the Microsoft store, but you can switch to Windows Home for free which let you install any programs.My only complain is when you scroll the screen up or down, it's not very smooth and sometime there' a lag like half a second, like your move your finger up/down, the screen moves the screen half second later._x000D_

  I have been looking for the perfect combination computer and tablet for ten years. They finally DID it. The new Surface Go is really light and thin, so it's easy to handle and take with you, and the size is perfect. It seems sturdy, and I don't worry about it being fragile. The screen resolution is fabulous. I also got a large screen monitor, and when I'm using my Surface Go as a desktop, I connect it to that. We just got new speakers with a huge subwoofer, and the sound from this is awesome. The Surface Go has 3 ports: a headphone jack (that's where I plug in my speakers), a tiny USB-c port, and the special port for the charging cord. You HAVE to get an adapter to use usb-a things (regular size) with this. I bought four different adapters until I found my favorite: the Lention USB-c Multi-Port Hub with 4K HDMI Output. Then I can plug in 4 things plus my hdmi cord from the big monitor. I didn't buy the Surface keyboard, but use a wireless full size keyboard with it. When I use it as a tablet, the on-screen keyboard pops up, and I use that. The 8 gbs of RAM are perfect for my use, and the storage memory is quite adequate. I can fit all my documents and music, but only some of my photos. I use an external hard drive for backup and for my photos. If you stream all your music, then you could fit all your photos. I always copy my music, though, so my music takes up a lot of space. I also bought the wireless pen. It will write on a blank page from Microsoft Word. If you choose to buy the latest Word, it will do handwriting recognition, too. There are also sticky notes and notes apps that work with this computer and the pen. So, this is IT, the perfect tablet/desktop. Highly recommended. Oh, and Windows 10 works with all my old software. Cool._x000D_

  This is a quality computer and it exploits all the features built into Windows 10.  The Surface line of computers are probably the best Windows systems out there but I could not afford a Pro so I went with the Go and am very glad I did.  It's everything I want in a tablet while also being a full-on Windows PC.  I first purchased the 4 GB RAM configuration and found it sometimes bogged down when running multiple applications.  I soon sold that one and upgraded to the 8 GB RAM version and it simply sings.  It wakes up quickly (facial reconition is SO nice) and I've never had it choke even though I've put it through it's paces.  I find I this system to be far more practical than and just as much fun as my iPad Pro.  It's an iPad killer, in my opinion, and for half the cost.Unfortunately, the Surface Go Type Cover isn't included in the price but really is necessary to get all the benefits of the PC ... seriously, Microsoft, you need to start including the keyboard with the computer already!  Having a compatible pen is also recommended but, unlike the Surface Go Type Cover, buying the expensive Surface Pen is not necessary.  There are several cheaper alternatives that work just as well.  I find the Wacom Bamboo Ink Smart pen has all the functionality as the Surface Pen and I paid $20 for it._x000D_

  The surface go is great for students looking to do only the basics on their computer. The processor is noticeably slower than the Intel core i3 so don't expect to speed through your daily tasks. I definitely recommend also getting the keyboard attachment since using the surface as a tablet is a bit uncomfortable, due to the size and weight compared to an Android tablet. The screen is amazing for the price and beats some of the thousand dollar laptops I've used. The battery life was better than I expected I got about 6 hours of use on full brightness in Photoshop and Microsoft office. With the 4gb of ram don't expect to have more than a few light programs open at once, if anyone is wondering Photoshop and illustrator cannot both run at the same time unfortunately. Don't bother try gaming on this thing because you'll only be able to play very old games at sub 720p with very low settings_x000D_

  Why did the product quit after six month?  Why did the company refuse to stand behind there product?  Why did they blame us for non existence  damage?  These are a few of the answers we may never know the answers to.We had the surface go for about 5 months when it completely quit.  This is a machine we use for testing and when it's not is use it is kept secure.  There was no physical damage to it at all, it just quit.It was past the Amazon coverage, so they sent us to Microsoft.  Our IT person did everything they suggested and nothing worked.  We were asked to send it in.  They told us it had EXTENSIVE damage and they would not fix it.  We ended up taking it to a Microsoft store who looked at it, saw there was NO damage and that it in deed did not work, they are the only people in the Microsoft world that  helped us it get a working machine._x000D_

  This thing is slow. Perhaps I've been spoiled by my personal laptop with Core i7 and snappy Samsung Evo SSD, but Surface Go is painfully slow when it has to work with more than one browser tab open. Its CPU is maxing out all the time when you open 3 browser tabs, or even two different apps at a time. Freezes and lags are not uncommon, either.But I think it will get the job done for me - which is being an ultra portable Windows device on the road. And despite its sluggishness, Surface Go is still better for some tasks than a smartphone. I will be able do some daily typing in Excel, access several work websites, and send out a few e-mails, no matter if I'm in Fresno, Frankfurt, or Fukuoka._x000D_

  I got this as a laptop for writing and occasionally streaming music while I work at a very boring one-man storefront. The battery life won't get me through a six-hour shift. In fact, it died after just 3 hours and 45 minutes of streaming music to a BlueTooth speaker. I think I will return this. My old Galaxy tablet can go for 10 hours on its battery. I found the pad on the keyboard very hard to use and the screen not very touch friendly, Perhaps my fingers are too old for this thing. The display was not all that much better than the Galaxy, considering how much more this thing cost. I switched to Windows, and that process took about one minute, so I don't know why that is an issue with some users. But this battery life of nine hours must have been measured with the thing idle and no screen. And it takes a relatively long time to charge, as well. After three hours, still not charged. Seriously don't like this purchase._x000D_

You can tell a lot of little details were obsessed over by Microsoft.  No, it's not a power-user dream machine.  But for what most people would need it for (web, email, light games, MS Office tasks, etc.) this is a truly productive device that can easily be taken anywhere.

  Revising and updating my original review, on the same theme: this charging connector that came with the Go is absolutely useless. Last night I shut down and left it plugged in overnight and IT MADE NO CHARGING PROGRESS. To add insult to injury, the battery popup said the computer was ""plugged in; discharging.""Do the hell what now?I am going to order a non-Microsoft laptop and put this one away -- after shutting it down and leaving it plugged in for a week or so to completely drain the battery. Microsoft, you really hewed the scrooch with this one.Oh, and by the way: No, I will absolutely not recommend this product to my friends. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy._x000D_

  I use this for school work. I completely stopped using my other laptop. Taking notes has become so easy. I write on my surface in class, access all my online books from it, stream lecture videos. I don’t even have to carry paper anymore. There’s so many cool features in one note. You can write with the pen and it does look a bit messy but if that bothers you, the software can convert your handwriting to text. It’s so easy to use I couldn’t recommend it enough. I think this is great for every student young or older. I bought the pen, keyboard cover and surface all on amazon. It came out to around $750. The only reason I’m taking off one star is because the pen doesn’t come with it. Regardless I think this product is a good investment._x000D_

  Ive been messing around with this computed for a few weeks now, Ive previously been partial to apple computers. I figured ive give this a go and reminisce of my old windows days. THIS COMPUTER MUST BE BOUGHT WITH ALL ATTACHMENTS OTHERWISE IT MAKES EVERYTHING VERY COMPLICATED. I initially wanted a tablet I could doodle on and travel with and really wish i would have  just paid a little extra and got an ipad pro or spent less and just bought a chromebook or something.In a nut shell everything about this computer is complicated... typing, drawing, clicking buttons, pretty much everything. It has a computer and tablet mode which changes how the computer works; for example tablet mode changes the desktop space layout and pops up a keyboard when you click in a typing space - computer mode does not activate a keyboard, so unless you have one bluetooth you need to switch to tablet. Clicking to navigate on webpages just stops working sometimes. Certain web sites like hulu has been very buggy and the app straight up doesn't work... Don't waste your money! This thing is probably the least intuitive device I've ever used when it comes to SO many things even as basic as spell check.AGAIN CERTAINLY DON'T BOTHER WITHOUT THE KEYBOARD AND PEN EVERYTHING IS NEEDED, BUT AGAIN DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THING! Im really confused with all of these positive reviews._x000D_

  Like most people, I love iPad but I have always yearned for a usable Windows tablet because most of my work programs are Windows. This is the first time I can see that this Windows tablet can be used day to day. I have tried Windows tablets ever since the first one came out in the early 2000s, which was a Toshiba 2-in-1. They've always been bulky with clumsy keyboards and handwriting recognition.This Windows tablet is just a little heavier than my 10 inch iPad Pro but still can be used in hands just like an iPad. The keyboard is usable and you don't even need to attach the Microsoft Surface Go Type Cover Keyboard. The handwritten recognition on the software keyboard also works good. Even the dictation on the software keyboard works well.It comes in Windows 10 S Mode and in that more you can only install the apps from the Windows app store. But a lot of my work programs cannot be downloaded from the Windows store. To install non-Windows store applications, you have to switch to Windows 10 Home, which is easy to do on the Windows 10 app store. Unfortunately, you cannot reverse it back to Windows S Mode. And that is my fear that it may become slower by installing all those Windows applications. Over the years, I have always been choosy in installing Windows 10 programs because a lot of them modify the registry and startup with Windows, which slows down the computer.But as of now, I really love this Windows 10 tablet!_x000D_

  i got this on october 26 and fiddled with it as-is for 3 or 4 days.  i didn't like the ""S"" version of windows at all, so i upgraded (easily) all the way up to windows 10 pro.  now i love it.  in this configuration it's simply a smaller surface pro machine. i now have a full windows 10 machine in a small-tablet form factor.  goodbye samsung tab s4 and ipad pro! my purchases and usages have always been a little schizophrenic among the competing OS environments, but i've generally favored the flexibility and power of windows (plus, to be honest, its familiarity).so, i've had no issues in daily use. everything works smoothly and there are no noticeable delays or hitches in using or changing programs. the hardware is nice and solid and good enough looking. bezels are a little wider than some other devices, but i like that for holding onto without having my palm or fingers sneaking out and activating something on the screen. keyboard is adequate. don't know that i'll achieve 100 wpm while typing on it, but keep your fingers curled in a little and you'll not do the 'hit-two-key' thing. touchpad is a nice surprise. i usually hate them and they usually don't work all that well for me. this one is smooth and predictable. that's all. nice machine. no problems._x000D_

  I tried a Surface Go and ultimately had to return it due to a battery issue.  However, that issue should not be common for most users, and I actually have other reasons for giving the Surface Go only a 3-star rating.The good:* Super light--the lightest PC/tablet combo that's made with any real quality today.* Works great if you are using it mainly as an ultralight laptop with keyboard and mouse, and are willing to accept its limitations in keyboard size, screen size, computing power, and battery life.  Would be an excellent light browsing device for travelers, or a note-taker for students or even business folks if they don't need a lot of CPU horsepower.* The screen is gorgeous at this price point.  It's not a Samsung Amoled or an Ipad Pro, but it's a far sight better than the cheaper Windows and Android tablets and low-end laptops that are everywhere.* It runs Windows 10 Pro nicely, for those who care to upgrade from the included Windows S version.  Counter-intuitively, upgrading the OS actually IMPROVED the abysmal battery life slightly.* Everything on the device's exterior gives a feel of quality.  There are no gaps, sharp edges, loose ports, mushy buttons.  The foldable stand feels smooth, tight, and robust, not a wiggle to it.* Value is pretty good relative to Android and Ipad devices.  This is an actual Windows PC that can run realWindows programs in a beautiful, light, tablet-sized PC for $499.  To get an equivalent sized and capability Android tablet, you're probably talking the Samsung S4 which, with HALF the RAM and storage, starts at $650 US.  An Ipad 9.7 comes in around $399, but it can't run Windows apps and is quite limited compared to this PC if you want to do work on it.The bad:* The battery.  The battery.  The battery.  Omigosh.  Read the online reviews, it's TERRIBLE compared to any of the serious competition at this price point.  Mine was even defective, but again, I don't believe that should be a common issue.  If you buy one, be prepared to plug in after just 2.5 or 3 hours if working/browsing and running at near full brightness.* Brightness.  The screen brightness is inadequate on this device. I had to turn mine all the way up to get it comfortable in even a well lit room, and it still seems below where I'd want it and not as good as phones and android tablets I have that cost less.  And if you're like me, and have to run the screen at full brightness most of the time, remember that battery is going to go even faster.* The included Windows ""S"" operating system.  Awful!  In these case, ""S"" must mean ""Stripped-down-to-near-nothing.""  Most will want to upgrade at least to Windows 10 Home, although I'd recommend Windows 10 Pro if you can swing the extra $ and decide to keep your Surface Go.  It's well worth it, and runs better.* Limited CPU.  You can see this in how much it slows down if you have several browser tabs open, and doing any common multi-tasking.  Also the device gets quite hot, when you push the CPU with anything challenging.  Some online benchmark testing which you can easily find indicates this CPU is really limiting you to tablet-like activities.  It may work well for ebooks, browsing websites, even streaming media if just doing one or a few things at a time, but you will not be able to push it beyond that.* Aside from battery life, here's perhaps the worst thing of all:  the tablet user experience was awful.  And I mean, just abysmal, compared to any self-respecting Apple or Android mobile device.  I'm a big fan of Microsoft, but honestly, they have never figured out how to build a truly touch-centric mobile device based on the full Windows OS, and this Surface Go is just the latest evidence of that.  I could easily rattle off a dozen things it does that are annoying, unexpected, or inferior to any Android or Apple tablet when using it in touch/tablet mode.  Anyone trying to use this strictly or mainly as a tablet will quickly get very frustrated with its limitations, if you've ever used an Apple or Android phone or tablet.  On the other hand, as mentioned above, if using this mainly with keyboard and mouse as a light note-taker or light-use portable laptop, it should be perfectly fine if you don't mind the extremely short battery life.I'd love to give this a higher rating, I really would.  I'm a Microsoft fan and generally love their software and other products.  But I couldn't recommend this device to a friend or family member._x000D_

  I like everything about the surface, except a couple things. The surface is great. However I do not understand why it does not come standard with the keyboard ($100 separate purchase which is quite expensive for a keyboard). Personally I only use it with the keyboard and when I occasional use it without it feels out of its element. Not to mention its heavily marketed with the surface. However I imagine people who use a pen and draw and write on the surface would not have this issue._x000D_

  The pen experience is amazing with that practically zero latency feature. Performance is very decent and can do everyday jobs quite well. I now like to use Windows 10 in portrait mode more than in landscape mode because websites and documents look dope in that orientation -- and Windows 10 handles portrait really well. The only problems I find is that the battery life and charging speeds are good enough but not excellent or exceptional in any way, plus Windows Hello doesn't work like 40% of the time. The kickstand is amazing and works just like you would expect it to. Charging via USB-C is possible! but you need a charger with ""power delivery"" built in, otherwise a normal phone charger (including a fast charger) will not be able to charge the device while being used (""plugged in discharging"") and will charge veeeeeeeeeery slowly if device is not being used. The build quality feels very premium._x000D_

  I ordered a Go right away after it was released with the anticipation that I could replace older desktops with a tablet solution. I was right. Pair the 8GB Go with Windows 10 Pro then connect it to a Plugable USBC-3 Thunderbolt enabled hub and  you have the perfect desktop replacement.  Way to go Microsoft._x000D_

  One note kept crashing everytime I tried to share. Although I had 8 GB ram and 128 SSD, the interface wasnt smooth and apps took their time to load. I dont know if this is an issue with just my device or if this is pretty common because of none of the reviews online seem to mention that (biased/ paid?) .One note failed to sync completely and I lost all the data. I contacted Windows support who could not find out the root cause to make one note work (despite working for almost an hour). They were very helpful though. Then one suggested to repair windows, which crashed the system completely. I repeat - Windows crashed on the first day.  I spent the next 5 hours preparing a recovery disk and trying to reinstall windows. Its so annoying to waste all that time.  What also surprised was the battery life- it drowned in about 5-6 hours and I wasnt even using it much (just one note).Bottom line - If you are expecting a great device for $640 ( including keyboard and pen), then reconsider. I feel this tablet is good in that you have a mini-desktop. But dont expect it will perform similarly to an actual 8GB RAM 128 SSD  laptop._x000D_

  This is a great tablet/ laptop. I bought this from amazon seller microtech, it was used like new condition, upon reviving my surface I noticed it was in it’s original packaging with all accessories included, I was very happy to have seen this, I inspected the device noticing it’s impeccable condition, no scratches or dings at all. After setting up the device I realized that they included a free upgrade to windows 10 pro, that’s very kind. I cannot believe how good of a deal I got from microtech, the device being in perfect condition a free windows 10 upgrade and all that for around $120+ less. I highly recommend this tablet if you are a collage student on a tight budget who also needs a windows 10 device for class, or if you just want a cheaper windows 10 tablet that functions well for internet media consummation.Also if you want a secure device this has a tpm built in which encrypts your data so that someone can’t just walk up to your device and steal information off your drives that are encrypted._x000D_

  I bought this based on reviews on Amazon and other pages.  It was purposely bought to replace an aging notebook and to take with me on vacation to Europe as a reader and to keep up with social media and confirm our airline and travel itinerary.  I got to use it the first day to read and on the second day as I turned it on it said ""no internet"".  When I tried to get to the wifi tool, a blue screen came up telling me the computer had crashed and was unrecoverable.  I researched this anomaly only to learn it is fairly common with this notebook and MS has been aware of it for over a year.  I hope i can return it since i had it for a month before vacation and was out of the country for 3 weeks..._x000D_

  Might as well be an apple product.Forces you to use only windows apps and windows web browser.If you want to use other apps or even just Google chrome as your web browser the drive forces you to switch ""out of s model"" which is something that ""can not he undone"", doing this makes the device slower and more buggy.I tried to use their new Edge browser to avoid this, but depsite multiple attempts and multiple methods, it would not import all my saved data from chrome.So I switched out of S mode, and chrome is slow to the point of being completely unusable on this device.It's clear they want to force you to use only Microsoft products on the device, and purposefully hinder 3rd party apps.Long story short, if you want to use anything outside of windows ecosystem, this device is garbage._x000D_

  When I purchased this device in August of 2019 it performed very well as a laptop/tablet. Very portable with good capacity for my needs including length of each charge. I use it daily for streaming music and news, on line browsing and shopping and WORD, EXCEL and PDFs. Since January it has started to act erratically and I'm now frustrated to a point that this needed a review.Touch Screen-Several times a week when I use the touch screen to scroll or open an item for background information it responds by enlarging the view and/or scrolling. I thought at first it was me, but after repeated attempts the same issues continued. Also, I've been using touch devices for many many years and I don't have issues on other devices with touch screens.Keyboard and cursor-The overpriced, Microsoft keyboard that I purchased for the Surface Go has quirks as well. A few times during any application I may be using, the mouse pad does not react to taps for an 'enter' commands.After Sleep mode and Reboots-About once per week I experience Settings that change  without  action/requests by me. Keep in mind that I am the sole user of this device. I usually figure out what needs to be done to redo settings and etc. This includes some that were default settings I never actively had set. Though I can accept some of this as learning opportunities it's frustrating to have to stop what I'm working to figure out the solution or work arounds.Volume button-Yesterday the volume button on the top of the unit felt odd when I depressed it to lower the volume. The result is that I can only use this button now to lower the volume, it will not work on the volume up side. Yes, I can control volume from the task bar; however, It has become my personal preference to use the button on the top of the unit. Now I do not have that.Looking for some reasonable logic to help me through this or fixes I can do but am just not aware of. I really want to use the Surface Go as I am comfortable with its performance (when it's performing correctly) and it's compact size (I can travel easily with it or even to meetings at work).Thank you._x000D_

  This little machine is the best secondary device I have ever owned! I can take this tablet anywhere and spend hours watching videos, writing code, answering emails, remotely connecting to my cloud servers, reading ebooks -- it's almost as capable as a full laptop in a tablet form factor.What makes this most surprising is that I am really not a fan of Microsoft. I am a hardcore Linux user, and have been using Ubuntu Linux as my primary desktop since 2012. I write code professionally, generally with non-Microsoft tech like Node, Python, and React.I wanted to write a review for other software developers. Here is what I can do on this Surface Go:- Connect to remote servers with ssh. Tunnel via ssh and connect via Remote Desktop to Windows machines.- Build and debug Node.js and React applications with VS Code.- Build and debug python applications with VS Code.- Using WSL to mount micro SD card (formatted NTFS) and clone Git repositories.- Run node applications with npm on WSL.- Installed VirtualBox and run docker on Ubuntu Server guest. (Vt-x is enabled.) Create and run MongoDB, MySQL, Nginx, etc. docker containers without issue.- Type on the keyboard 95% as fast and comfortably as my full size keyboard.- ...and watch movies, read books, surf web, send emails, etc.Performance is surprisingly good. I'm not expecting i7 level speed, but this is remarkably faster than atom based machines I've owned. It really exceeded my expectations.I was tempted to wipe the machine and install Ubuntu right out of the box. However, I decided to try out Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I'm glad I did. It's been a seamless integration experience so far. I installed Node via nvm, git, and other utilities in WSL. I run VS Code to edit code that I've cloned into a folder on the SD card.Docker works with Docker Toolbox (using Virtualbox). Though, I decided to just create a normal VirtualBox VM and run docker from there. The Pentium Gold 4415Y supports virtualization just fine.I wouldn't use this as my primary work machine. (I have a Lenovo x270 i7 with multiple monitors for that.) But, if you are a technical user like me and have been searching for a device you can take anywhere (bookstore, coffee shop, airport) and be productive without sacrificing a lot of utility, then this is it!I think Microsoft actually nailed it with the Surface Go._x000D_

  Product is legit and actually came earlier than expected. I bought this because I needed something more portable to work with between school and work. My main laptop is 15.6"" and it is a pain in the neck carrying that thing around. I've only had it for a few hours, but so far I'm satisfied with this purchase. I saw many people on various websites, forums, and videos gave this device a somewhat poor rating and review. Personally, I feel like those people are expecting too much out of a small 2-in-1 machine. It's not supposed to be on the same processing level as your main laptop or desktop...I haven't taken it out of S mode because I don't see myself using any apps outside of the window store (that's what the main laptop is for). So far the performance is fine. The only issue is that it charges kinda slow, but I didn't really have any huge expectations.  I would definitely recommend this for people who want to be productive on the go. It's perfect for emails, notes, web browsing, presentations, etc. Will probably update this after about a month or so of use._x000D_

  When the Surface Go was first announced, my initial reaction was ""YES! Take my money now, Microsoft!""I was in the market for a Windows tablet/PC that wasn't too cumbersome to carry around. Several months prior to the release of the Surface Go, I had gotten a taste of Windows tablet computing with the NuVision 8-inch touchscreen tablet PC. It was a relatively inexpensive device with only 2GB of RAM and a 32GB SSD hard drive. Despite those serious limitations, it ran Windows 10 well enough and I was able to install and run a Java IDE and a variety of 3D modeling and animation programs on it. Adding a micro sd card helped with the storage limitations a little bit, but the unit was always going to be hampered by its storage limitations.Enter the Surface Go. When I first purchased the Surface Go, the plan was to use it while commuting and at work and then switch over to using my Yoga 2 Pro laptop while at home. Surprisingly, my Yoga 2 Pro doesn't get as much usage at home anymore thanks to the awesomeness of the Surface Go. I snagged the 8GB Ram, 128 GB SSD version and added a 400GB microsd to it and immediately installed a wide variety of programs(Cubase Pro, Photoshop, Video editors, LightWave 3D, Maya, Blender, programming, Unreal Engine, Unity 3D, etc.) on it, all of which ran well on the unit. Every now and then the CPU gets noticeably bogged down and sluggish depending on how many apps are open at the same time, but that usually happens for short periods and then it runs smoothly again. That's to be expected given the type of CPU was used in the Surface Go. I knew that going in and was totally fine with it. I'm really looking forward to see what Microsoft does with the Surface Go 2 whenever they decide to unleash that on us. I'll be a customer on day 1!_x000D_

  I did not do research and assumed that this latest gen windows device would be able to do latest gen things, like access network drives! If you do a internet search you will see that this is a prevalent problem and maybe 30% solvable with back door hacks, changes in registries etc...not the best experience for someone who just wants something to work outside the box. This issue is a classic one with windows devices, as when you have an issue, you have to go digging for answers and questionable fixes. I bought this tablet to do work on the go, and while the screen, the hardware and everything out the tablet, the pen and the keyboard are excellent, this was a deal killer for me, so thus had to go back. A shame._x000D_

  My relationship with the Surface Go is a tough one.  “Upgrading” from a 2015 Macbook Pro, I thought, “Oh!, My old Macbook has 8GB of RAM and the Surface Go has 8GB of RAM !  They are equally as fast !”  Buyer beware: the Surface Go runs on a mobile Pentium Gold processor, which is not the Intel i5 that the Mac boasts.  This computer runs slower than my Macbook running Windows.  I am a software engineering student and I have to use a Macbook for class.  I like to bend the rules so I installed Windows System for Ubuntu on my  old Mac.  Then, I replicated the system on my Surface Go and bought a new keyboard, so the Surface Go just sits on its kickstand which is really high quality.Speaking of quality, despite being slower than my 5 year old Macbook, it’s relatively fast; fast enough to make me want to use it over my Mac.  Everything about the Surface Go screams quality, from the display, to the touch screen tablet/desktop mode, to the audio quality, even the materials.  All great.  There is an SD card port, and a USB-C port which I recommend suiting with the Anker USB C Hub found here:  (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H4VQ4BZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)Battery life isn’t great, but it is decent.  Overall, great product, but I would make sure you get the right keyboard and mouse set up to make it an optimal experience._x000D_

  I think the Surface Go is a fantastic device if you don't set your expectations unreasonably high. For reference, I got the 64GB base model, a black type cover, and a Surface pen.After unboxing, setup takes slightly longer than ""just a moment"" as the device likes to say, but if you've already got a Windows 10 device, it's pretty quick and easy. Following the initial startup, the device will need to download a variety of updates, but within 2 hours or so mine was fully up to date after multiple installations, restarts, etc... standard computer update affairs.I switched it out of ""S mode"" almost immediately, because I didn't want to be bootstrapped to the Microsoft store, and it's nice that they give you the option. It doesn't require any restart or anything, and allows you to install apps from anywhere.Regarding performance, I have done email, lots of internet browsing and video watching, movies, drawing, and light photo editing and social networking. The device is not lightning fast and it doesn't need to be. It rarely lags more than a second or 2 to open programs but if you're used to a higher performing desktop or laptop then you will notice. The glossy screen is beautiful and photos and videos look great. There are front firing speakers that sound pretty decent but not much better than your average smartphone speakers, but this is understandable. The device makes zero noise as well, no fans or spinning disks are present here and it rarely gets hot to the touch.Really any light duty thing you would do on a normal Windows 10 PC can be done here. And that's where this thing shines, it's versatility is just head and shoulders above laptops because of how wonderfully portable it is. It feels sturdy, good in the hand or in the lap, and the fully adjustable kickstand is magnificent. In my opinion, the add on keyboard is absolutely essential. It clips on quickly and easily with nice strong magnets. The keys are small and take some getting used to, but having a full keyboard with back-lighting in this form factor is amazing. They are far better than on screen typing. The trackpad is also wonderful, it looks silly large on there but that is a good thing. It's responsive and has a nice clicky feeling.I don't think that the Surface Pen is nearly as essential, but it is fun and works excellent. I could see myself using it for casual note taking, there is virtually no noticeable lag.The charger the device comes with has a proprietary port, but you can also charge it via USB-C, which is great if you have a phone with that port, because you only need one charger while you travel.The only things worth complaining about on this device are made up for by its sturdy build and excellent functionality. It makes a fantastic bridge between the smartphone and PC, perfect for when a smartphone just isn't enough and a full size PC is too much. You don't even need to stow it during takeoff and landing on planes!!! So, set your expectations to a realistic level and the Surface Go, even the base model, will meet them.As an added bonus personally, the Surface Go has helped me use my smartphone less, to the point that I removed most social media from my phone. When you don't have Facebook and Instagram in your pocket at all times, it is pretty amazing how quickly you realize how often you used to mindlessly scroll through your feeds. So you could say it has made me more mindful of my screen time and helped me leave both it and my phone in my pocket or out of reach more often, which we could all use a break from now and then.One more thing... this one is just a tip. Don't buy office! This device has a small enough screen that it qualifies for the free version of MS Office Mobile. Search online for how to get them!UPDATE 2/4/19: I've owned this for several months now and have had zero issues. Changing out of S mode and installing Chrome and other non-Windows store programs has been no problem, no noticeable impact to memory usage or performance. Battery life is still good, just a great little device to have._x000D_

  There are of course positives and negatives to a device like this one.  But in this case the positoves are very strong, and the minuese less so;Positives - it's Windows.  So it runs pretty much everything you want it to.  It does so well enough, if not at a screaming pace.  The screen is amazing.  It's sharp, saturated and very contrasty.  Brightness is quite good.  Sound is fairly good - better than other tabs, not as good as the Galaxy S4 Tab or the Surface Pro 6 (which I also own).  It's amsll and light.  The Surface keyboard cover is very good, if a little mushy.  But it does it's job well. The touchpad is excellent.Minuses - like the Surface Pro 6, it is not a great tablet in tablet mode.  Windows is just not well suited to tablet mode.  It does work, but Android does a better job of it.  Sound is not as good as the Surface Pro.  battery likewise is nowhere near as good.But it's still an extremely good device.  I carry it with me everywhere because hey, it's a Windows laptop in a tablet sized package - and the first WIN small device worth carrying.  It's not perfect, but the compromises are easy to live with,  If you are looking for a tablet sized gadget that can do double duty as a small laptop, here you go.  Get it._x000D_

  I bought the 8GB/128GB option and just here to give a quick summary of my tests, advices, and usage experience for anyone looking for specifics.GOOD POINTS first - BAD follow ups:+ Screen resolution & details look beautiful (-) 10"" display = 1800x1200 res (Max) + (Recommended) 150% font scaling or you will squint your way to a new pair of eyes at smaller scaling options.+ Type-C USB port (-) Type-C USB port :/ IF you're like me and have many plug-in devices (keyboard, mouse, charger, etc., have a USB hub and a Type-C to B adapter at the ready).+ Compact, VERY SLIM, and lightweight (-) (For packability, I guess this is the obvious downside)(cont.) The processor is exactly 1608.00 MHz with 2 cores and 4 threads, i think (RT only detected 2, I'm not all computer geek so let me & everyone who don't know as well if this is inaccurate) so don't stress/overload the system with excessive tabs/processes/intense processes.(+/-?) NO Keyboard so expect to spend ~$20-$60 getting either the pre-built one specifically for SGo or bluetooth keyboard or connect your wired-connection one like I do.Though I already overclocked my main PC for work n think it's unecessary to test this, I still ran some basic XS Bench and Sensor Test on Prime 95 v26.6 for heat capacity of the tablet. The photos show my results but the main conclusion is although it's unimpressive compare to other larger setups, for ~$520, this is a very decent low-profile tablet to be carrying around for work (typing mainly).The surface is good and I'm fine with no keyboard since I have my custom cherry mx silent red with shock absorber rings keyboard I've been using for a long time. I would recommend you mess around going through all settings options before your first run to have it match your needs (turning off/on options for specific functions to extend battery life/increase performance - not by much but still a quality of life improvement).Good luck hope this helped somone :)_x000D_

  I don't think this would make a good tablet as the apps available are limited compared to iOS and Android devices, but it does make a great little computer for a kid or someone who does a lot of traveling and doesn't want a bulky laptop weighing them down._x000D_

  This product is not that great as it sounds. The picture quality is very mediocre and I feel ipads have much better screens. The product itself is a bit slow, it’s alright but it’s not great. The product comes with windows s mode which can be later updated to 10 for free. The keyboard you need to buy separate.Maybe it’s better of a choice to go for a different product like the yoga from toshiba.This is just over rated and does not deliver the punch it should_x000D_

  I tried one at the Microsoft store really impressed. But the unit I got sent is unbelievably slow and buggy. From a very dim screen. Keyboard not working. Constantly locking up and needing reset. Touch Input on screen not working. Wifi not working. Many more problemsI just purchased this. And I don't know if it's just my unit but I am stuck with this. No warranty. No support. No help.So now I have to go buy something else that will preform the function I purchased this to do. But it is unable_x000D_

Ive spent less on better...my asus chromebook flip is better than this honestly. I don't see all the hype, thinking about sending it back but ill give it a little more time play with it a little more. Nothing special about the specs...it moves a bit slow...its cute but that's about it. Honestly wish I would have waited and really weighed out my options. Will update my review with a little more play...but so far its just blah._x000D_

  I've been a Surface fan for several years. I have the Surface Pro 3, and tried the Surface Laptop. At this point in time, one of the more power intense devices isn't necessary for me. I actually returned the Surface Laptop because I didn't feel I used it enough.The Go hits the sweet spot for me because the size is perfect. I primarily use the device from the couch, so the smaller size is a lot nicer. It's very comfortable to hold and so lightweight! If you don't need this to function as a workhorse computer then it is perfectly adequate. I have a business laptop, so never do work from my personal computers. So for me, this is really all the computer I need. I'm not a gamer or editor, so I basically just browse web forums, watch youtube or Netflix, and other basic tasks. I have Word, Excel, etc installed too which is super nice. I think for people in my use case, the Go has plenty of power.The Go's speed is pretty good. At times it seems really fast, and at other times I do notice it is a little slower than more powerful devices. I mostly notice the slower speed when opening new apps or screens. I played a simple game from the Microsoft Store (one of those cooking themed games) and was surprised at how speedy the Go functioned. It really didn't lag at all while I played it. Videos also look crisp and clean on the Go. The only time I noticed the Go acting buggy was with the touch pad keyboard. There were occasions when the keyboard would not open when it was supposed to. The on screen keyboard is sufficient for web browsing, but I would much prefer an actual keyboard for doing a lot of typing. In this regard, I do think you should pick up a secondary keyboard for the Go. I would honestly just recommend the Microsoft keyboard made for the Go, since it was made for this device. It will connect to it perfectly and makes it really easy to travel with. However, if you are only going to use the Go from a desk and not travel with it much, you could probably just choose a cheaper keyboard. It is a shame Microsoft doesn't just include the keyboard with the purchase.Overall I'm really happy with the Go. For me it was a better fit than the Surface Laptop (also a good device but more power than I needed, and the size was preferable on the Go). The main cons are the keyboard not being included in the price tag and the general price of the Go (I bought the 8gb version). If the keyboard was just included in the package it would make the overall price easier to swallow. For basic tasks or as a secondary unit this is a great computer. It has the great build quality of a Surface device but in a more compact device._x000D_

  The Surface Go is great as a secondary device that's easy to take around with you pretty much anywhere. It's perfectly sufficient for basic productivity on the go (with the typecover), for media consumption like youtube and Netflix, and for touchscreen specific tasks that a desktop or larger clamshell style laptop isn't suited for, like taking notes or (nonprofessional) artwork (with the pen). I personally use it for all of these things on a daily basis, and I've never been disappointed, even with the 4GB model. However, if you're looking to replace a more powerful machine (Surface Pro, laptop, or desktop) I don't think that this or even the 8GB model will be sufficient._x000D_

  I love Microsoft surface! I have a surface pro 3 that I have had since 2014 and I love it. I wanted something smaller, lightweight, and a bit more like a tablet and that’s exactly what the surface go did for me. I cannot tell you how pleased I am that Microsoft made the surface go! I can take it anywhere and carry it anywhere. In the picture I put it in a case already (which was obviously sold separately)._x000D_

  I had a Surface Pro 4 and loved it and needed to replace that, The Go is a bit smaller which makes it really nice for travel but it also works well at home. I have office onboard and everything works great. 8 MG ram onboard too.  The only way I can get a second monitor connected is via my Surface pro desktop connector. The Go cannot connect to an external monitor so if a second monitor is a must then this may not be the best option. No USB connection either so my camera etc all require different approaches for file transfer. With these notes, I am still very happy with the Go._x000D_

  I received the product on August 15th, turned it on and immediately was prompted to update it to the newest Windows update, so I did. After a hour-hour and a halfish process, the computer restarted and I was greeted with an error screen. I contacted Amazon and Microsoft about ten times over the next month, was told numerous times that the next time I called, I'd be able to resolve the problem. Once sat on customer service for over two hours. Couldn't get a replacement because apparently this is an issue with all surface gos that is made clear. Finally was told I'd be receiving a USB along with a USB-c adapter. This was about three days before my college classes started (aka the whole reason I bought a new computer) and the fastest I was able to receive it was after my classes had already started so I was left $500+ in the hole with nothing to show for it (I also bought the type cover and warranty). I bought a cheap $100 chromebook to have while I waited for the parts to arrive. Finally, my package arrived and lo and behold, I was only sent the USB-c adapter and still had no way to fix the computer after a month of customers service. The $100 USED chromebook works better than a brand new $400 windows. Moral of the story, don't buy this computer unless you love talking to customer service reps for hours on end with no solution in sight._x000D_

  After purchasing the Microsoft Surface Go in July along with a 4-year Asurion protection plan, it was dropped and the screen needed replacing.  In good faith (of Amazon's service and Asurion's purchased plan) we sent it off to be repaired.  Asurion said that the computer could not be fixed (when all it needed was a screen replacement) and credited my Amazon account with the original purchase price (minus the cost of the four-year plan which was $100.  Upon calling Amazon and talking to Rojay, I was told that the four-year plan would still apply to a replacement computer of the same model.  We conferenced called with Asurion and they said that their technician decided that the computer was beyond repair ""according to Microsoft standards"" and went on to inform me that Amazon's representative was incorrect and that, once the plan had met it's requirements it was no longer valid.  What?  So once it has to be used one time it's no longer valid.  Cracked screens are replaced all the time.  Asurion has basically just stolen $100 from me.  In going back to Rojay with Amazon, I counted on Amazon to help me.  After all, we've been customers for a long time and spent a lot of money with the company.  So have our family and friends. In the past, when the customer has obviously been the one not at fault, Amazon has stepped up.  What I got from that point was ""We can't do anything about Asurion's policy.""  Can you at least credit me the difference between the current sale price on the computer and what I originally purchased it for?  (A difference of $38.50)  ""No, I'm sorry.""  After talking to Rojay's supervisor Kat, I was given the same unsympathetic denial and, to make matters worse, a repetition of it no matter what I said in a irritated tone.  It's amazing how someone can say ""I'm sorry"" so many times without actually trying to help you. So buyer beware.  Don't buy expensive electronics or the psuedo-protection plans from Asurion through Amazon.  Now I'll have to either wait in the hopes of the current price going down to purchase a replacement or pay extra out of pocket because of the careless policies of a company that should take care of it's customers better.  Amazon - you need to do what's right by your customers instead of leaving them out in the cold.  This is how you lose both customer confidence, loyalty, and business._x000D_

  worst electronics experience of my life. strait out of the box plugged it in, turned it on, it loaded for a min. then an error popped up: stop code: IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL. then for the next five minutes it just kept tuning itself back on poping up with different stop codes and i couldn't get it to stop so i unplugged it. After half an hour of it just unstopably restarting itself after each new stop code it got to extremely hot (almost burn you hot) and turned off. more then willing to try and just exchange it for a working one, but the only options on here are to return it wait a few weeks for a refund and buy a new one. making it more then a month before i would receive a hopefully working one_x000D_

  I felt like the information was very misleading because of the picture, I assumed the keyboard came with it but it did not. So I had to spend another 100 bucks between a keyboard, a mouse and a pen. I thought the screen was a little bit bigger to, kinda hard to get my school work done on. I think it's to much money for just the screen for sure. Also it's sent in s mode, therefore you can't download any app or anything unless its Microsoft.  I need webex for school and zoom for school but it won't let me download or switch out of s mode. Complete waiste of money_x000D_

  I think the Surface Go gets enough praise in the community so I will focus more on my experience with it. I think it's the perfect tablet for casual and semi-professional users.I have it as a secondary device mainly for portability and when I don't need to lug around my 14"" laptop to a cafe. Despite its size, the 8GB/128GB model handles my workflows without failure. I have used the Surface Go for remote access work, playing old games which need some graphical capabilities, watching TV, Skyping, etc. and it has all been a pleasant experience. The battery lasts long enough (up to 5 hours of continuous use)  that I can get work done without reaching for the (very light and portable) power brick often. The screen and color accuracy is amazing and the device can be blinding at full brightness, really impressed in this department. The front-facing speakers sound great and clear without being tinny and the microphone is not bad too. Both front and back camera are clear in good lighting. While it is not very snappy, since it runs a single core processor, once it gets going, there are very few hiccups. You don't easily get tired using it, especially with the Alcantara cover to supplement the device. I expected the device to struggle when opening up large Word documents and PowerPoints but it handled it surprisingly well and I could get as much work done as I would on a desktop. However, I recommend an external monitor if you want to use the Surface Go for serious productivity, the small screen will give you neck-aches. I/O is minimal but has a headphone jack!To name a few cons, the main I/O is a single USB type-C which means that it's dongle city from now on. The other option is to buy the Surface Dock but that has a price tag laced in gold. The screen off button sits too close to the volume buttons and I get them mixed up often. Maybe a textured button would solve the issue. It does run a little hot when using the pen and writing for an extended period, slight discomfort may be felt.Regardless, the Surface Go packs a powerhouse in a miniature slate and it suits many different tasks but should be focused on media consumption. I would hazard a guess that it struggles with heavy computation but that is to be expected from a passively-cooled system. But hey, it plays my games, movies, TV, and can browse the web without hiccups and is a fully featured Windows 10 system, what more can I ask for?_x000D_

  I bought this laptop for some reason. I had a car accident and sustained many injuries, and several bones were broken. I was instructed by my therapists not to carry heavy items in my backpack. So, I needed an item to be enough durable, lighters, good battery life for my Ph.D. work. Someone suggested this and I bought it when it was initially released. It was working well, in terms of its battery timing, and I have discovered after a few months that its battery was draining after 2 or 3 hours.Other than this, its touch screen is good, and I liked its pencil which i normally use for writing on MS word.But this product need further improvemnet in terms of its battery life.

  This was the worst device I have ever owned. I returned it after 48 hours of use. The on screen keyboard is clunky (doesn't work with the installed apps) and hard to use. Installing apps is not easy, and the Windows Store is anemic. Built in speech to text is way behind even Google dictation. The screen is small and FEELS very small because of poor space management. The touchscreen was not as reactive as most modern touchscreens I have tried, often missing letters as you type on the on screen keyboard. I seriously get more function out of the $99 cellphone I got on eBay. And then when I decided to return this device,  it took TWO AND A HALF HOURS to factory reset it. I have never had a device take more than 10 minutes. I was seriously unimpressed and couldn't wait to return it._x000D_

  I've had my Surface Go for almost 6 months now and I love this piece of equipment. It works well for me, both as a tablet and as a laptop substitute for basic functions. It is perfect for me and I greatly recommend it. Here are the most salient points:1. SCREENScreen quality is great for streaming videos and for reading.2. PERFORMANCE AS A LAPTOPThis works great as a laptop surrogate for basic tasks. It is fast enough for simple tasks, such as checking e-mail (I use the full-blown version of Microsoft Office, including Outlook), web browsing with multiple tasks (I usually have 6 or 7 tabs open at a time), music player, casual gaming, etc.File explorer gives me full access to my Network Attached Storage (NAS), where I backup videos and pictures and connects to my home network.I took it out of S-mode after a couple of months. It's kind of limiting under S-mode, but it's still useable. It supports full Office and the Edge web-browser (specially the newer version, based on Chromium), is robust enough for me, though I don't rely heavily on extensions.I can connect to my port hub and control 2 extra monitors (1 full HD, 1920 x 1080, and another one 1280 x 1024) plus the tablet's monitor; external keyboard and mouse, and speakers. With this setup, it works perfect as a laptop substitute. That being said, one thing I don't quite like is that the Go only has one USB-C port, which means that you have to get a separate adapter if you want to plug in any external device.3. AS A TABLETIt works well as a tablet, as well. I use it mostly for reading e-books using Amazon's Kindle Reader version for Windows, streaming videos, checking the news, etc. The only disadvantage is that the Microsoft App Store is not as robust as that for Android and iOS. You could give a try to the emulators that would let you run Android apps, but I haven't had the need for them.4. BATTERY LIFEIt's OK, not great, but it does the trick. I'd say it can play video for about 4 or 5 hours, enough to keep you entertained for a full long flight. Under lighter activity it can last about twice as long as that. On standby, it will last about a week between charges.5. ACCESSORIESI love the stylus features of the tablet. It works great and it can recognize my handwriting perfectly. This is the best of the features of the Surface Go and I highly recommend it. I use a knockoff stylus that is not the greatest, so I'd suggest going for the real thing when it comes to styluses, or at least not the cheapest one, as I did.For keyboard, I use a Bluetooth one for 8-inch tablets when I'm on the move, and the keyboard attached to my port hub when I'm at home. This one I'm not missing the official one and I think I can do without it. I'd buy it if it were in the $25 - $50 range, but, for my use case, it's not worth the $70+ for the brand one.Overall,  I'm very happy with my purchase and I highly recommend the Surface Go._x000D_

  Fine machine but is in ""S"" mode which is not advertised. What is ""S"" mode. Microsoft will not allow YOU the OWNER of the machine, that YOU PURCHASED to download or use programs they don't like.

  I had high expectations for the surface go, even though it comes with a Celeron processer, which are usually underwhelming in terms of performance, and in this case as well.  The go is light, and feels like a quality machine.  The display is crisp, but more bezel than expected.  The keyboard, that must be purchased separately for around $100 is well made, and functional.  The go is comes ready to go with Microsoft ""S"", a stripped down version of windows 10, that requires you to use Microsoft apps exclusively.  It sucks, but is easily disabled, so mostly just an annoyance.  BATTERY LIFE SUCKS, I cannot stress this enough!  Can make it through one, but not two full length movies without charging.  Speaking of charging, the magnetic dongle for the wall charger is ok, but the C port charger is slow, and sometimes doesn't work at all, so charging on the go will be an issue.  My biggest complaint overall is performance, especially using anything other than Microsoft apps.  It is slow, locks up intermittently, or refuses to run the apps at all.  Trying to browse with Chrome will drive you to distraction!  If you are an Amazon Prime video fan, keep in mind there is no Amazon supported app for windows.  You can watch Amazon videos, but not download, and you will have annoying toolbars that you can't hide.  For a tablet that cost nearly $700 with keyboard, I could NOT recommend this product.  Microsoft has become almost as maniacal as Apple about limiting customer choice, which is why I avoided Apple in the first place............._x000D_

  Why I love this thing, it's because it does way more for me than what tablets promised to do. If you are looking at chromebook type devices, this is a much more versatile device imo. It's a full windows OS so I never need to think ""will it run this program that I normally use"". It will. I wouldn't recommend it for use over 3+ continuous hours because this is a 10"" screen afterall and it will strain your eyes especially if you like smaller fonts. The GO works perfectly for me because from time to time I need to log into work to do work and I don't feel like carrying my laptop with me everywhere in case I need it. GO is much lighter and is perfect for those cases where I need to spend 45 minutes logging into the office to restart a server/service etc. But being a regular laptop it works offline. While you won't be able to do much with mobile apps since windows mobile app is pathetic. But for content consumption like watching movies, you are better off with windows than ios or android because you have access to full VLC, windows media player and all the other wonderful tools that doesn't required a walled off garden and the permission of a giant corporation to be allowed to install it. I don't care if MS likes it if I install something or not because they can't control it. So I no longer have to carry a laptop and a tablet when I travel. This is sufficient.From a practical stand point, think of what you can do with a i3 processor and thats what the surface GO can handle easily. Adobe Premiere seems perfectly fine. I wouldn't try hard core gaming. It's not designed for that kind of stress. Anything else, it will run fine. It won't get hot, no throttling. Don't like that it only have 1 USB C and no USB A. Don't like the idea of dongles on a mobile device. Defeats the purpose. The alcantara keyboard is very responsive but I find that I do make more typing mistakes because of the size. But it's still comfortable enough to write a document without making me Rage. First thing I did was get rid of Windows S (stands for stupid) and go right to Windows 10 Pro. I already have a surface book so I didn't need to buy a pen. For those complaining that this doesn't come with a pen. I personally would have hated a pen to be included because nothing is free and they would have jacked up the price of the base model with a pen. Since I already have a pen why would I buy another one?One nice thing you can do is that win 10 now supports casting from your android and ios devices (latter is more temperamental because well ... Apple). So I can navigate through youTube or kindle on my phone and cast it directly to my Surface GO and get a bigger playback screen. It's basically remote desktop for mobile devices but with view only. Doesn't take a genius to realize that MS is eventually going to make interaction possible ala remote desktop.So for 1-2 hours workload or not knowing when you need to work so you need to carry a laptop with you always, I'm thrilled with this device. I got it during the holidays and deals. Paid $403 for the device with 8gigs ram/ 128gig ssd. $105 for the alcantara keyboard. Another $30 for a 128gig microSD.Biggest gripe is that I wish the bezels were smaller and the screen closer to 11"". If they just improve palm rejection there wouldn't be a need for thick bezel. 2nd gripe is the lack of USB A. A minor gripe would be the power supply is not the same as my surface book which has a usb A on it for charging devices. They could have just used the same charger._x000D_

  A couple of things upfront: (1) I returned this thing after only a single day, (2) I'm not an Apple fanboy;  Generally, I'm not too fond of Apple as a company, (3) I'm a professional engineer and design software, electronics and mechanical assemblies for a living.I purchased my Surface Go as a replacement for an iPad Pro supplied by a former employer.  I chose the Surface Go as a replacement tablet primarily because of its lower cost.  Other major plusses were its ability to run Linux and normal Windows development tools.  I figured this capability would be really handy.  I also liked the fact that it had an SD slot.Perhaps the unit I received was defective, but I was unable to make it through even the initial setup without constant bluescreen crashes.  I tried to get windows through its initial full update cycle over the course of an evening and never completely succeeded.  I experienced constant bluescreens and the same situation you find on a desktop where updates fail to apply for mysterious reasons.  This was all straight out of the box.After dealing with this massive level of out-of-the-box unreliability, I determined this device was unsuitable for it's intended purpose and returned it.  After so many years with the iPad, I expect my tablet to be dead reliable with little to no lag and reliable ""instant-on"" performance.  It was immediately clear to me that the Surface Go (at least my copy) was not going to deliver this.The physical device seemed decent.  Its build quality was not up to the iPad standards, but it was acceptable for the price point.  The display quality and touch performance were quite good.  I wanted to like this thing. (I really wanted to be able to run embedded development and debug tools on my tablet!) However, it was clear from the very beginning that it wasn't a very good tablet and wasn't even a reliable computer._x000D_

  Have you ever been in class and gone to take your notes/book or anything necessary for that class and been flabbergasted at the amount of room these materials take up? Then this is a great product for you. The Microsoft surface Go is small and compact enough that it will slide straight into your carrying bag hardly taking up any room. This will free up the need for carrying multiple notebooks for various differing classes.Note: For optimal use of this product, The Microsoft Surface Pen and access to Microsoft Access is a must.Being able to sync all your notes from your home desktop to this device using One-Note will allow a smooth flow of note keeping for all your classes. You’ll never be more organized when it comes to staying on top of your classes than ever been before. On top of being able to take typed notes within One-Note using this device, if you obtain the pen, you'll also be able to draw any diagrams that appear within your classes as well. You’ll be able to organize and take detailed notes for your various classes, breaking them down further into topic sections. This product is also great for use after class, when you just want to kick back, relax and watch your favorite shows on Netflix or any other viewing apps. Speaking of apps there are a multitude of drawing apps you can investigate and find if you fancy yourself someone who wishes to delve into your drawing skills.This product is well made, and you’ll be able to experience long use times between charging; allowing for longer periods of enjoyment and note taking. Even when you go to charge the Microsoft Surface Go, you'll notice that this device charges extremely fast with the charger it comes with. If you had to witness a weakness of this product, then it would be durability. While this device can be written and drawn upon; be careful of its screen as it can be knocked off tables or dropped. You never want to watch the device you use have its screen broken. Being a Microsoft device, you'll be able to back up all your data through the cloud, being able to easily retrieve your lost data that should also be easily synced with your Microsoft account. Microsoft also offers insurance on this device to allow for cheaper replacement cost, as well as offering a flat, but higher cost to replace without insurance.Overall: Great product with good use for school and casual activities after. You’ll not be disappointed buying this product!_x000D_

  If you need a PC to do light work and can live with a 10 inch display, you'll love it. Or maybe you want a tablet that can be more than just that. I like the whole philosophy behind it, a device that you can take anywhere and use it in all your activities. After using it at work I can take the keyboard off and watch a movie or browse the web while listening some music or use a pen to do some digital painting as a hobby, It's just so versatile. I think this is the closest thing to what Microsoft wanted to achieve with the Surface line. Even closer than the already great Surface Pro.And there's this premium feel to it. The magnesium body feels very solid, the kickstand doesn't move if you don't want to and if you pair it with the Alcantara keyboard it's just a very different experience that you can feel. And yet it's so light. You'll have a disappointing experience touching a plastic laptop after using one of these.The downside is that it isn't precisely cheap. If you want it to be more than a tablet, you'll have to add the type cover keyboard, around $100 or more if you buy a Microsoft one (it's also great but I'm not reviewing it here). This just happens to be an affordable Surface product, and they're always expensive. But also so versatile and innovative that you'll find they worth it.It's also very sturdy. I found that out yesterday (there was a dog involved), it fell from a feet high right on the edge of the screen. I thought I would find a shattered or cracked display, but there was nothing on it. Not even on the edge, not a single dent or scratch on the whole thing, and it's working like if nothing happened (I'm using it to write this review).Most people complain about relatively short battery life but you can work for hours on it. I get it to work the whole day with the screen at its darkest and the battery saving mode on. Unless you use it outside that's enough brightness and performance for what you'll be using it. Another common complain are the thick bezels, but they're there for a reason, which becomes very obvious when you use it like a tablet.This might not be the device for you if what you want is high performance for CPU or graphic demanding tasks (and of course it's far from being a gamer PC) or if you really hate Windows. But if you're looking for a portable PC/tablet you can't go wrong with this. It's light, sturdy, completelly silent, has a sleek desing and offers a full desktop experience. And if you already own a Surface Pro you'll find this fascinating and even charming. It's a scaled down version of it._x000D_

  Great portable computer. I have the Surface Pro 3 so I am familiar with the Surface family. I decided to see how long I can use the Surface Go with windows 10 S OS, which means that you can only install apps from the MS Windows Store...so far, so good. If I have a need to upgrade to Windows 10 Home, the switch is very easy via the Windows Store...just remember, you may have to update the Windows Store app then the upgrade to Windows 10 Home, for free, is available.I use this as a secondary computer to surf web, watch Netflix, work on MS Office documents...works exactly as advertised._x000D_

  This is an outstanding device for what it was made for. Received it yesterday and found it to be more, much more, than I expected. The quality build is what you would expect from the surface line. The battery life could be better, but until the battery industry provides improved battery size, weight with performance, this is what we have to deal with for this size screen and quality with an intel chip. Most reviewers are bashing this thinking it should do what the surface pro does, how comical and disrespectful of their responsibility as professional tech authorities. My advice is to try it for yourself. Don't listen to the naysayers. This is an outstanding mobile device that has the ability to do on the go what you couldn't otherwise do with this size package. Are there improvements to be made, yes. But we didn't get the surface pro out the door before we had to deal with surface pro, 2,3, and 4...just saying :)Just a couple things on the other review.1. Upgrading to Windows Home from S mode was a breeze. Not sure what the other review was talking about, and it's free.2. Your going to have updates. This product was built and packaged way before they could update it with the latest firmware and other neccesarry improvements. Before you start using it, always go to update it to the latest software and firmware improvements. It didn't take long at all._x000D_

  I love the product itself, but be aware the warranty does not start from the date you purchase, but the date the distribution purchased it. I just purchased this and the warranty on the device shows it ends in less than 6 months(It says it comes with one year). Also, due to the fact that the warranty is 6 months in already I cannot add Microsoft Complete. Save yourself some time and order through Microsoft itself. I’m guessing this is because Amazon is not an authorized selling agent of Microsoft._x000D_

  EDIT, 8/18/18 - So it's been almost a week since I've had my Surface Go. I still love it, but I'm beginning to see the limitations of this device. The limitations are due to Windows 10, not the hardware itself. And I feel that these limitations are very slight--slight enough for me to keep the rating at 5 stars. I feel that these tiny issues are ones that can be adjusted or fixed with software updates, and that's fine with me. The device is still great as-is, but Windows 10 needs little tweaks to make the device better--that's all I'm saying.Personally, I think the issue here is that Windows 10 isn't built for mobile devices. It's still for devices that are meant to sit on a desk or table and aren't nearly as portable--like PCs. The Surface Go is great because it's so portable, but it can be better. For that to happen, Microsoft needs to tailor Windows 10 to make mobile devices like the Surface Go function like a mobile device should. For instance, as it stands right now, I can't listen to music or podcasts with the screen off. I can do that with my iPhone or iPad. But I have to babysit the Surface Go, just like I have to babysit my PC at home. I have to be sitting around, making sure the Surface Go remains awake. Sure, I could mess with power management settings, but why should I have to do that? The competition doesn't require me to do that. Microsoft needs to match that.Many mobile devices have widgets or other controls that can be accessed without unlocking the device. I feel that Microsoft has to match this, too, with Windows 10. It also needs widgets that can be accessed without having to unlock the device. Just very basic controls--turn wifi on or off (for real, not this garbage with Apple disconnecting from wifi for a day), and basic audio controls.Finally: Windows apps should be optimized so that a user can get away with using programs without a stylus or keyboard of some kind. Along with the Surface Go, I have an Ockel Sirius A that I got through an Indiegogo campaign earlier this year--that device has a screen that's about the same size as your average phablet, and it runs on Windows 10. A stylus, mouse or trackpad is definitely needed if you want to get work done on it, even if you plug a lager monitor into the Sirius A. I understand that--Windows 10 just isn't built for a screen that small. But I don't think there's any excuse for a device like the Surface Go that has a screen that's, what...about 10.5""? Like an iPad? And on an iPad, users are expected to be able to use apps on that tablet without needing a stylus or trackpad of some kind. But I can't say the same for the Surface Go. Some of those icons--like taskbar icons, or some of the buttons or drop-down menus I've seen in iTunes, as two examples--are still too small to select them with just a finger. You'd still need a stylus/mouse/trackpad to use the Surface Go as-is. And, sure...of course you can mess around with the display settings on the Surface Go to fix this. But again--why should I have to do that when the competition doesn't require me to do that, and the apps on the competition's devices work just fine without extra hardware of some kind?Overall: Microsoft is getting there when it comes to mobile devices, but it also still has a ways to go to keep up with the competition.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I just got my Surface Go yesterday, and I have to say—it’s a genuinely nice device to have. I like it a lot.I plan on using the Surface Go as a “workhorse” device. I do a lot of writing and I work with spreadsheets, so that’s mostly what I’ll be doing on the Surface Go. I also have iTunes on it—I’m in the middle of downloading some albums to it right now—and I’m downloading some Netflix shows to watch later. The Surface Go can handle all of this very well—and I plan on keeping it in S mode, just to see how far I can go with this device being this way.Word and Excel docs, along with iTunes and Netflix, is pretty much all that I need a device like the Surface Go to handle. I’ve seen at least one tech reviewer (iJustine?) play Fortnite on her Surface Go review unit, so it’s not impossible to do it. It’s just—playing games is not a priority of mine for a device like this one. I want this device to be the one that I’ll do some actual work on. If I want to do fun stuff, I’ll use my smartphone.Overall: I think the Surface Go is a nice device to have if you want a backup computer—something to do the bare minimum of what you expect your average computer to do. Also, just remember who this device is supposed to be for: students and enterprise. If you’re in a school or business environment, then this’ll be a great device to have._x000D_

  I have been using the Surface Go with 8GB of RAM for a couple months now and have become a big fan of what Microsoft has created. The tablet ships with a light version of Windows. I would have been content with keeping that version if the Microsoft App Store wasn't a ghost town. I opted to complete the one time upgrade to Windows Home, which I recommend as you will have access to a far greater selection of applications. One note of caution is that the Surface Go is a smaller form factor so utilizing certain legacy applications may be frustrating as menus and controls are small and hard to control with touch.I also purchased the optional type cover as I intended on utilizing the tablet for productivity apps and it works great with the tablet. It is a great accessory that makes the tablet far more useful.I have used Samsung and Apple tablets along with a Pixelbook as I needed small form factors for traveling with that also could be great media consumption devices. For productivity purposes the Samsung and Apple tablets were frustrating compared to the Surface Go especially in comparing the attachable keyboards and how well OneDrive and Office 365 work. For media consumption the Apple and Samsung tablets were better only because they have a native Amazon Prime Video app. For some reason Microsoft has not prioritized getting Amazon to produce a native app for their tablets yet. If they do this will make the Surface Go as good as the Apple and Samsung devices for offline Streaming services. The Windows OS is better than iOS and Samsung's corrupted Android due to its versatility especially with file management and being largely application agnostic. Apple does not want to make it easy unless you use Apple services while Samsung can't streamline their file management.The Pixelbook's Chrome OS there really is clunky compared to what can be done with the Surface. The Pixelbook is elegant and has the best keyboard I've used, yet the Chrome OS is challenging and hasn't figured out how to make Android apps work seamlessly on the platform. With the switch to the Surface I also ditched the Google line of productivity apps that suffered inefficient interfaces and seemed half-baked with limited features. Although Office 365 does cost money and Google's does not, you get what you pay for.If you do not want to be tied to a single ecosystem that is stifling and expensive (Apple) and want a more refined experience than what Google has achieved with Android or Chrome then the Surface Go is a great option. This is the first table I've actually come to be a fan for.I gave the tablet 5 stars for the quality of the device and OS. I wanted to give this product less of a glowing review due to the ghost town of the app store, but that should not be solely Microsoft's fault as developers are free to do what they want. That being said Microsoft makes up for a lot of missing functionality due to its legacy desktop apps that can be accessed if the OS is upgraded to Windows Home.Now Microsoft needs to really spend money to get developers on board to make this OS more useful in tablet mode._x000D_

  I got this computer to replace my full-powered laptop, while at school and traveling. Despite how compact it is, I never feel like I'm working on a small screen (like with my cell phone). Although the keyboard and stylus are not included, you can find them both very cheap on amazon. It works seamlessly with both the keyboard and stylus, the battery life is as advertised, and it can handle any non-graphics-card-intensive programs that most budget laptops can handle. I wouldn't run more than two or three programs on it at once. If you do, it will slow down quite a bit._x000D_

  I bought this to use for school (for taking notes and whatnot) and for reading and it has served its purpose well. Paired with a pen it is useful for taking handwritten notes, paired with the keyboard its is good for typing notes, and the battery life isn't super shabby (6ish hours with mixed us, 10 hours for just reading or taking notes without using Chrome/Edge). Using edge DOES give better battery life though. I definitely recommend, but perhaps there is a v2 coming out soon._x000D_

  Buy Apple or Google.Piece of junk. Only used it a few times a month but still only lasted 6 months. Microsoft tells me they have on at the store 45 minutes from me. I drive there to swap it out to then be told oh we don't have it. No other option given even after telling him I was told you had one and I drove 45 minutes just to swap this out. Just a stupid look from the technician. So after waisting 2 hours I still have a broken Surface. Now on the black hole call with Microsoft no_x000D_

  I believe I was sold a previously used and returned product. I ordered my Surface Go and received it July 2. On August 14, I turned it on to discover a blue screen and a message that my computer had to be repaired, just 6 weeks later. I made an appointment at the Microsoft so.e to resolve this. I was informed thay despite having received my computer in July, my warranty had been inacted in May! Within five minutes the Microsoft associate was packing up the Surface Go and handing me a new one. Do not buy from Amazon! I ended up buying a Surface Pro also, and got it on sale which was exclusive at the store. Amazon tried to saddle me with a defective device._x000D_

  I received my product yesterday and was able to review the contents upon opening. I have owned the larger Surface Tablets before, and this one is just as fast as the ones I have owned, yet more sleek and portable. Don't let the size fool you, nor reviews, the performance is outstanding for the size and what it has to offer.The Surface Go has a very nice box display, and even better opening the package. The package has an iPad feel to it when opening, making you oddly feel better about the product and its representation. I added the type cover to the surface with an easy click and bend up. It worked seamlessly right away.To start, the Surface Go was booted up, went through all the set up very easily, and now is incorporated at my desk attached to a USB C 5 in 1, and hooked up to my HDMI 32"" Screen.Positives:Fast for the most partSizePortabilityQuick InterfaceWindows transition to Windows 10 HomeWindows 10 S for securityTouch screenWindows at the size of an iPadNegatives:Can be somewhat slow when opening multiple programsNot a slew of apps like the Apple Store hasNot to be used as a workhorseOverall this product will be very useful to me now, and in the future.I highly recommend this product based on what it has to offer, especially if you love the feel of an iPad. This will get more done than an iPad. Very useful for school, for mobile work, for at home computers, and portability uses.I will check back in a few months for an update after consistent use._x000D_

  A nice little device but I can get a bigger iPad for less money and have WAY more functionality and app access (especially free educational apps for my granddaughter).  I wanted to use this device for a digital planner and discovered the apps available for Android pale in comparison to those available for Apple ... and I have NEVER been an Apple user.  I know Microsoft and computers but this was still not very intuitive to use and the Android apps seem clunky and lacking compared to apps for Apple._x000D_

  In less than a year the product got super slow and I had to do two resets! There is no way to do a factory reset without depending on other device or external media which does not come included with the device. What a waste of money!!!_x000D_

  There's a few reason why I bought this. One is the weight of it, it's definitely easy to haul this around on campus. Two, its capability to take notes. I took if off S mode because I require the Google apps for a lot of things and I couldn't have it with S mode. Anyway, the size of the screen is great and it doesn't feel like I struggle to read things. It's got great volume for its size. My larger laptop has ver low volume and it makes it hard to watch videos for my online class but it's not a problem for this little thing.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. I'll be even happier once I can get all my files on it but I need an adapter for that !_x000D_

  Only had the GO for a couple of days, but so far I am extremely pleased with my purchases. First thing I switched it out of S mode and  it is running software like a champ!Very solid machine and great small platform. Comes in at just over 1lbs with the type cover and protective case.Strongly recommend_x000D_

  It's good to bring to school to take notes for girls. I have been using it for two years. However, if you want to do multiple tasks, it turns slow. Anyway, It's not heavy, that's what I want._x000D_

  Had it for about two weeks. I use it mainly for Word, PowerPoint, Excel and web browsing to do homework. Speakers sound good enough and the kickstand is amazing. I haven’t tried any gaming on it but that’s what gaming PCs are for. I have the 8GB RAM 128GB SSD model._x000D_

  It's fast enough for everything I need to do during my travel. I used it for importing, geotag and adjusting my photos with Capture One. Works fine. Not super fast but fast enough. Battery life is good. I really hope it have 2 usb c port so I don't need to bring extra adapter to charge my surface go._x000D_

  I'm thinking  of returning. I received this today. The first application I installed from the Microsoft Store crashed when trying to open. I installed it minutes after turning it on. I tried to open OneNote and just get an error. The pop-up keyboard stuck and wouldn't close. I've heard good things about the surface but my experience has been horrible._x000D_

  Loved the Go and getting used to taking notes and replace my handwritten notebook. Love the size and easy to carry around. Just had to buy the surface pen._x000D_

  Bought the Surface Go to work on documents while traveling to Europe.  I have other laptops but the Go is so portable for writing an Internet access while traveling, that is hard to beat. The screen is fantastic and the keyboard the same. Only wish it had a little better battery life. But with an extra battery pack plugged to the C-port  problem solved._x000D_

  This is a great product, I run both Windows 10 and Ubuntu, and it works great. Be advised that I've never been able to get more than 4 hours on a full charge._x000D_

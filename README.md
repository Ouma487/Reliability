# Big Data, Big Trust: Assessing Reliability in the Online World

## Description

This project is dedicated to uncovering hidden insights about web reliability by analyzing customer reviews from a prominent e-commerce website. In today's data-driven world, online reviews have a significant impact on consumer decisions. Our goal is to use spaCy, a natural language processing library, to extract information about defective components and failure modes mentioned in these reviews. To learn more about the methodology and the fascinating insights we've uncovered, please read my full article

Big_dataset_2,Big_dataset,"Overall, a good experience. Fast and responsive to touch or keys. The backlit keyboard was a very nice touch. Light weight. The screen itself was clear and visually impressive. I loved the simplicity and utility of the Google Chrome OS user experience. Battery life was impressive. Charge it once and it would work all day unless there was extensive usage, and even then it was fast charging to get you along without worries. My issue was with the build quality. Within the first month, I noticed that the back shell part of the screen would come up when opening or closing on the left hand side (facing the screen) of the left hinge. It wasn't a big deal, but I should've returned it. The issue got worse over time until it was both sides of the left hinge and then eventually spread to both hinges. This past week, the shell back of the screen came completely apart from the screen and the screen cracked. It was not a short process, taking about one year and nine months since initial purchase date, but for the price paid I would've expected a better build of the product.

Big_dataset_3,Big_dataset,"I got this Chromebook recent for a trip I needed to take. My Windows laptop is quite large and I was looking for a smaller alternative. So far (I've had it for a month or so) I'm really enjoying it. Sure it's limited compared to a Windows machine, but for day-to-day web and email use it's great. I've also found that Android apps work great (although some games are laggy) and the battery is awesome. I'm now carrying it to work and with the limited use (some gmail and web use every once in a while) I'm getting almost a week of standby.  The case feels well made and it's light but solid. However, I already have a couple of surface scratches even with keeping it in a bad. Overall, great little machine.

Big_dataset_5,Big_dataset,"Good battery life, thin and lightweight, handy touch screen. The flip feature is cool but we probably could have bought a conventional Chromebook -- we almost never use it in tablet configuration though my wife loves the touch screen.It's made it through a few family vacations unscathed, but be aware that the case is a faux aluminum plastic, not real aluminum like a MacBook. My wife dropped it and cracked a small piece off leaving the right-hand USB-C port flaky. I got a USB-C power pass-through hub so we get by with the remaining left-hand port.

Big_dataset_6,Big_dataset,"I would give this zero stars if that were an option. I have had this for just over a year and the battery completely died. I have used maybe once per month average (so 12 uses total) and store in my house at room temperature. It looks as if it just came out of the box.Even worse ASUS accepts no responsibility and the customer service is TERRIBLE! A few days out of warranty and they want to charge me big $$$ to even look at it.Do yourself a favor and don't even consider this option unless you want a computer that won't function and a company that won't assist in any way to fix!

Big_dataset_7,Big_dataset,"Great little laptop. Fantastic battery life, quick charging and very responsive.  You can add apps from the Android app store and add extra storage with a micro SD card. Keyboard is a bit small for my larger fingers, but I'm getting used to it and the speaker leaves a bit to be desired if you want to listen to music, but I use ear buds anyway so it's not a problem. It's not a Windows machine, but for me that's not a problem at all as I use it mostly for Internet browsing and email. Works as a tablet, but I haven't used it as such very often. Yeah, I'd buy it again.

Big_dataset_24,Big_dataset,"This is a great Chromebook... when it works. I like ASUS, the Chromebook itself was great. It has great build quality, keyboard, screen resolution, and other things. But my Chromebook won’t charge anymore. I know it's not the charger because I have used that to charge other things and it works fine. I’m assuming it's the Chromebook’s battery or something that is dead. Normally I'd not get too worried but I've heard their customer service is horrible and after talking to them I agree.I have read through the comments and I see that this is a problem that has happened to many people as well. I’m not sure if ASUS knows and just doesn’t care. If these many people have had the same issue I feel like the company should do something about it. I’ve been reading at all the horror stories of everyone who has sent in their Chromebooks for repairs. Whether it takes super long to get it back or if it just breaks again. I talked to their support and they recommend that I send it in for repairs but I’m almost afraid to send it in after all the other people who had troubles.Not sure what to do because I do like ASUS but this issue with customer service and the company itself makes me want to avoid them totally. Probably won't recommend any ASUS products to anyone.

Big_dataset_27,Big_dataset,"After doing a lot of research, I finally settled on this Chromebook because other reviewers liked it and I wanted one with a touch screen that could flip into a tablet form. I expected that it would take some time to get used to because I just came from a fully functional Macbook, and I was prepared to make the transition in terms of cloud storage and streamlining my workflow/paring down the number of apps I use. Turns out this is mostly good for watching movies. The trackpad does weird things and selects and deletes whole paragraphs of text or jumps around on the screen inside of a word document. The Google Docs app is terrible--I can hardly see what I'm writing and I spend so long trying to find simple functions that I uninstalled the clunky app and went back to using the browser version of Docs. Things get a little better when using the touch screen, but trying to mouse around the native Chrome OS can be unintuitive and clumsy. Also: WHY WOULD YOU GET RID OF THE CAPSLOCK BUTTON?! Every time I try to capslock, I bring up the stupid search function. I miss my Macbook SO MUCH.

He is able to charge it about every other day and it will last him for the time he needs it in school and for homework.We had to return it within a couple of months because the keyboard stopped working. It was repaired by asus without much trouble except for a little over a week of no computer to use. However, the same issue has re-emerged over the last couple of months with random keys not working. It is getting worse. So far my son has either plugged another keyboard in or used the touch screen. I will need to contact customer service again.Other than this recurring and frustrating issue the computer works well and my son likes it.

Big_dataset_36,Big_dataset,"I purchased the C302A from Amazon last summer. When it worked correctly it's a great machine. I think the Chrome OS is plenty powerful and versatile enough for the vast majority of users, perhaps as much as 95 percent. I am a writer-researcher and there was nothing that I did on my old Windows machines that I couldn't do on the C302a. The hardware which would be middling at best on a Windows laptop was very fast on a Chromebook.Then in February, I began to have persistent audio problems that required me to shut down and restart the C302a multiple times a day. I contact ASUS and they issued an RMA and I sent the machine to ASUS for repair. I got it back about 2 weeks later and within an hour the problem began all over again. I contacted ASUS, got another RMA, sent it back and got it back yet another two weeks later. Nothing had changed.This time, the ASUS rep told me to send it back for exchange. That's when the fun started. I did as requested and heard nothing from ASUS. Previously, they had sent me emails acknowledging their receipt of the machine. This time, crickets. I checked FedEx which confirmed that ASUS had received the package. When I called I was told that they were awaiting my response to an email giving a choice between several possible replacements. No such email had been sent, much less received. I finally got to speak to a supervisor who called me the next day who confirmed that no such email had been sent and that what was actually happening was that they were waiting for a suitable replacement to be available -- someone else's problem child -- so that they could recondition it and send it to me.Now, I wasn't crazy about getting someone else's problem but that's all that was on offer. Yet ASUS screwed this up, too. They never got back to me and when I called we were back to the ""we're awaiting your response to our email"" version of events. What's more, when I called their support number again, I got a message saying that they were closed and to call back during regular business hours. At 12:30 p.m. EDT.Yet another supervisor -- I got through by calling sales and insisting on being transferred to support -- on the ""escalation team"" repeated the ""we're awaiting a used C302a we can foist on you"" (albeit not in those exact words) along with a promise that yet another supervisor would call me the next day which she did. And these were the exact words I was told ""[Your replacement] is currently in the process of being shipped with a replacement unit of the same model. Once the replacement unit has been reserved for your RMA, the replacement will be shipped to the address below.""""In the process"" could mean ""forging the aluminum needed to make the case which will then be assembled into and sold to someone else and then returned.""As of today, I have no idea of when or even whether I will receive a replacement from ASUS, much less whether that replacement will be any good. I'm out nearly $500 with little recourse against ASUS.Avoid ASUS like the plague. They do not stand behind their products.Update:it has been several weeks since I posted this review and nothing has changed. Actually, that's not true. Asus has managed to add insult to injury. Twice. I called Asus to inquire as to the status yet again. Yet again, I was transferred to a supervisor who promised to ""escalate"" the matter despite my protests that this matter had been elevated so many times that it was halfway to the moon by now. It was all he could do. That and a promise that someone would contact me within 24-48 hours, Needless to say at this point, that didn't happen.The second insult was here at Amazon. After my initial post, someone from Asus ""customer loyalty"" added a comment insisting that this experience was atypical and violative of the company's standards and asked me to contact him or her so that they could help. I sent an email with the details. As if to prove my point, I haven't heard back from them.It's almost as if they are trolling their customers.Update 2I finally got my computer back. After I posted the previous update, the ASUS representative emailed me and reiterated that he/she had contacted ASUS and told them to make my case a priority. Given my previous experience, I was skeptical. But a few days later I received an email from FedEx telling me that a package from ASUS was on its way.The replacement came in a box that gave no indication whether it was new or refurbished. In any case, it looks like new and works very well.So, does this change my rating? As I said earlier, if you like Chrome OS, and I do, this is a great laptop. It's fast and has a great screen and keyboard. It's not as loaded as the Pixelbook or even the top-of-the-line Samsung, but it cost less than half as much as the former and hundreds less than the latter. Its build quality is easily comparable to both.So the machine itself is a 5-star laptop.Unfortunately, my customer service experience was abysmal. It was only ""resolved"" because I made a nuisance of myself by posting here on Amazon. I believe that if I hadn't taken a step that I find personally distasteful, ASUS wouldn't have responded. If it were possible to assign a sub-zero-star rating for customer service, I would.So, should you get it? Only if you know that there's a chance of an experience like mine and that of several other raters. Perhaps buyng a used or already furbished one with a Square Trade warranty is the best way to go.

Big_dataset_37,Big_dataset,"I had bought this almost 2 weeks ago mainly for writing and watching youtube and Netflix, just basic stuff. I had watched reviews on this prior to buying and it seemed like a good choice for my needs. The main reason for choosing this was the extra space compared to others that were similar. It is listed as 64gb and after first turning it on before installing anything else, it said about 49gb. I saw reviews saying this and it is true but hasn't proven to be a problem, just a little disappointing. One thing I was concerned about was the screen, in videos, it was noticeably dimmer compared to other products. I was slightly worried about how it would look, but it seems to be very nice. Although, if you plan to use this outside in the sun, it is harder to see. I was sitting in direct sunlight, I haven't tested it in shade tho. The sound seems to be great to me, not an expert or anything, but it works and sounds great. I do use earbuds most of the time tho.Tablet mode is a little awkward, but not awful. Battery life is good, not spectacular, but good. It all depends on what you are doing, writing and browsing the web will last about 8-10 hrs, videos will last me about 4-6 hrs. It seems to keep its charge very well when asleep, I usually keep it unplugged all night and doesn't lose much charge. Very light, haven't weighed it or anything but is very easy to carry around. Also, love the backlit keyboard. I don't really take notice if a keyboard is a low or high quality, but I really like it. Speed of the laptop is really nice, runs smoothly and very fast. I used to use a really old laptop before this that was horrible, so I don't really have much to compare this to.CONSOn the play store, if I go to music artists, it will close the app. I don't know why, and that seems to be the only this that does that, the app has ""updated"" a couple of times but haven't seen a change. Will update if it starts to work.The touchscreen is sometimes a little unresponsive, rarely, and it will work fine after I tap it a couple of times. Not a big deal to me.I downloaded the Microsoft word app to use instead of the cloud because that is what I was used to, but I need a subscription. I have the same app on my phone and don't need a subscription, so I don't know what is happening there, but not a big deal, I will just use the cloud.I have a USB storage drive that I use to keep all of my pictures and music backed up, and I was planning to use it on this also. It is not a USB-C, but I had bought an adapter to use with it. But it doesn't work, both the adapter and the drive work, I tested them on separate devices. It's just that the app I use with it doesn't recognize that it is plugged in. Haven't really tried to work out what is wrong, but will update if I figure it out.I also low-key really want to play the Sims 4, but can't on this, I knew that when I bought it and is not the fault of the Chromebook. But next time I get a laptop, I will probably just get something that runs Windows.Overall, this is a great laptop for me. I will update if anything changes my opinion about it.

Big_dataset_40,Big_dataset,"I'm not particularly happy.  Had it barely 2 days before the screen cracked (received on May 29th, online with ASUS the morning of May 31st)!  I did not mishandle it; it was either on my desk or in a padded sleeve when it wasn't in use.  It seemed great for the few hours I got to use it.Getting it serviced through ASUS has been a slow process. It took about 3 days to get the shipping label (purchased for $15); 2-3 days to ship; 1 day after arrival at the facility to be noted as ""received"".  It's now the 4th day since it arrived at their facility in Texas. (Had to ship it because there aren't any local facilities - I'm nowhere near Texas, Georgia, New York, or Puerto Rico.

I'm learning how to use Google drive for storage (got 100 extra GB with purchase of the chromebook).  Never had an ASUS before and I did a lot of research in advance.  Excellent reviews overall.  Wonderful battery life - getting between 8-10 hours on a full charge.  That is amazing compared to the notebooks I've used for years.  I still have a notebook, but it now seems like a Rhino compared to a Cheetah!  Only thing I don't like is that there is not a dedicated CAPS LOCK button on the left side.

I remember when I had my old Dell laptop & would type or work at night I sometimes couldn't see the keys had to use my phone for a light, this won’t be an issue with the keyboardTablet mode - Really the tablet mode isn’t that great the dimensions make it super awkward to try to use this laptop as a tablet so I personally don’t use it much , if you don’t end up using it a lot make sure you download the apps for what you use instead of using tablet mode on the website so if you want to use the laptop as a tablet on youtube download the app instead of going to youtube.com on your browser it’s kind of a “duh” thing to do but just putting it out there because if seen some people use it on websites mainly instead of appsCamera - is good, decent quality if you decide to record yourself or webcam someone on skype if anyone still uses thatHinges & flipping the laptop -  This was one of my biggest concerns thinking if I moved the screen a certain degrees it would maybe be too heavy & the hinges would get loose or break & then the screen won’t hold it’s position but it definitely did whether its wide or close the screen will hold it’s position and you can flip the laptop to tablet mode as many times as you want without worrying about it coming loose or not hold its shapeBattery life - good last me 8 to 9 hours on average last pretty good whileWifi connection - no problems there it connects as its suppose to you will see the icon for wifi only shows 2 out of 3 bars being filled normally meaning you might not have a strong connection but I wouldn’t worry too much about it I tested my connection still going strong & fast @ 100mbps for downloads 10 Mbps for uploads speedBluetooth - works well is able to pair pretty quick to devices no issues yet**My Warning ** I would highly recomment checking out all the reviews on amazon all the lower rated ones they are very concerning & is the reason why I was on the fence about gettting this latptop& why you might be too a  lot of the reviews are about a common issue that some people experience examples like laptop arriving doa (dead on arrival) keys not working, screen having pixels die , speakers being super low, laptop stops working after a few months or even one month , charger not working to charge the computer anymore , screen froze , hard reset won’t work anymore , even the 3 star reviews are concerning because some say they did get the same issues but they sent it in & got it fixed that’s why they are not pissed & still gave a decent reviews the lower 2 or 1 star reviews are from people that had the computer break or stop working & most of them did not get a chance to get it fixed either their waranty expired , the return date ended or customer service just took forever to help out , so i highly recommend if you do end up getting this laptop to record a video of it when unboxing it for proof also right away instead of seeing all the great fetures it comes with look to see if anything itsn’t working or doesn’t seem right like keys, speakers, mouse, screen anything in case you have to return it right away ,  I cannot garauntee it will work for you 100% from the sounds of it some people got a good product others got a crappy one it feels like risk to purchase this product not knowing if it will work for sure or not, if you do get it I would buy the protection plan yes it’s another $100 - $300 but if you get this computer and it breaks and the opertunity to return it to amazon passes after a month you would have spent all that money for nothing. I like the laptop it works good for me no issues yet so i will give it a 4 stars not 5 because of the risk of it being a bad computer that you might get or a good one

Big_dataset_73,Big_dataset,"I love this form factor!  It is probably the best form-factor laptop I have ever found.  It is small, light, portable, and when you fold it into a tablet, the edges actually line up (unlike most Windows 2-in-1's).  It is a solid build construction.  I have tried to find a similar Windows laptop that I could turn into a Linux laptop, but unfortunately, I couldn't find any with a decent rating.  Asus's closest offering has bad reviews.I like that ChromeOS lets me tinker with the OS, installing Crouton so that I can install Linux.  Unfortunately, there has been a glitch that won't let me install or run Kali or Ubuntu (with GNOME).  I have only been able to install XFCE.  Also, there is no Crostini support yet, so having native Linux apps at your finger tips is a no-go for now.I have considered just converting the whole thing over to Linux, but I can't bring myself to do it just yet.  ChromeOS's big advantage is that you can wipe and restore the OS in minutes.  That makes it great for overseas usage.  Getting OpenVPN working was kind of a pain last time I did it, but I managed it.  Unfortunately, American Airlines didn't recognize ChromeOS or wireless usage last time I flew them (and my company only flies American).I now have an Acer Spin 5 for travel purposes.  It isn't as light or portable, but it has Windows 10 (yuck) for compatibility, and I can boot Ubuntu 18.04 from an external USB-C SSD.  I use this Chromebook when I want to plop down in my chair and jump on the internet in seconds.  It has enough power and memory to easily handle 20+ tabs open.  It can also do Zoom video chat relatively well, though I will still get a hiccup once in awhile.ChromeOS is a great alternative to Windows and Mac OS X for people who just need something to get on the internet, and they never want to worry about viruses or updates (and who aren't terribly concerned about Google knowing everything about them... that is the one major downside to ChromeOS).If Acer sold this laptop with Ubuntu 18.04, I'd buy one for everyone I love!

Have a good battery life, enough to get me through the day2.  Be small and portable, enough to fit into my small backpack3.  Function as a tablet while I laze around the house4.  Was under $500This device hits all three of those points.1.  I haven't run the device down to empty yet but I use the device during the day for meetings and during lunch and then I use it when I get home for various other things.2.  The size is good, although I would have preferred if it was just a tiny bit smaller.  I think the best option would be to keep the screen size and get rid of the bezel, allowing for the device to be an inch or two smaller.  Overall, not a huge deal and I am okay with how it is as a fair trade for the cost savings.3.  You can look at the stock images to see how it flips around, so that shouldn't be a surprise if you are reading this review.  The thing it does really well is run android applications without any problems.  I use it to play games (nothing crazy), browse the web, or stream from plex and it does all three really well.  I have noticed a tiny bit of lag when playing some more intense games but usually just closing everything else running solves that issue.  If you need the more horsepower, go for the more expensive model.4.

Chrome OS also eliminates any need for thought when it comes to setup, almost entirely. Login to your gmail once you have the device turned on, and you're pretty much good to go, of course, if you're me then finding the appropriate shade of metallic silver wallpaper to complement the exterior aluminum casing or to match your plush, faux-fur lined sleeve can take days. So jet black it is.I thought to purchase a comparable 2 in 1 with a fully detachable keyboard, but figured it would only be another way to achieve having something break, get lost, or result in injury. I'm pleased because the hinges make such great hinges I was surprised I never thought how hinge-worthy hinges could be my whole life... These are Ultra hinges! I am so relieved to have them holding the attached keyboard, it gives me peace of mind, and comfort. Much like the smart, soft, back-lit glow and comfort of the aptly spaced keys for a device this size, I must say.There won't be an issue with lagging for any everyday user, unless you're ""computering"" with french fries, which is practically a criminal offense, or at least it should be.  It's when you get to be more involved in whatever it is you should, can, would, or shouldn't be doing on your device that you need to consider upgrading to a more premium processor, display, with more virtual memory, etc. at which rate, you need to either find a job that pays enough for you to move out of your mom and dad's place AND/OR consider a more physically substantial device with a larger screen anyway...I personally have a bad habit of leaving a dozen or more browser windows open while running about that many apps, tinkering with devices in my smart home, streaming surveillance, online retail therapy for things no one will ever need, and sometimes even pretending to work ""work,"" (I am winner #1 of best online office lunch catering order - in case you want to know the secret to my success and pay raises) but none of that seems to slow this cute Asus down at all... ;-)Then again, what do I know...?... I pressed the search key a lot thinking it was caps lock for the first few days. Not that I'm old fashioned. Not at all. I love having my android connected and synced. Easy. Streamlined. Efficient.

The machined aluminum is soft and all edges are rounded over. This allows for hours of typing without getting irritation on the underside of your wrists where you rest them. One area of improvement would be the speaker location/size of opening.... It's identical to the charging port and in the mirror location so sometimes at night I find myself trying to insert the plug into the speaker grill on mistake...I wish the speakers were louder!The screen is good for a sub $400 laptop. Full HD 1080p with touch-screen and convertible hinge. I'll be honest, I rarely use the touch-screen because I prefer the trackpad/keyboard combo and don't want to always clean my screen. I'm tired of the trend of micro bezels.... The border allows you to hold onto the device without accidental inputLastly, it has a microSD card, which I have 64gb holding some of my favorite movies/tv shows that I'll watch when away from wifi. All my documents are saved on Google drive and I've never felt like it's an issue. Contrary, it's nice to start an Excel project on my Chromebook, and continue working on it on my work desktop without having to jump through hoops or carry a USB jump-drive.Hope this information is helpful! I fully recommend this product and I purchased it through the Amazon warehouse store for a $70 savings... Arrived in mint conditionI've recently purchased a budget HP windows laptop for $400 and it pales in every way when compared to this Chromebook. Speed, browsing, ease of use, simplicity, features, quality of materials/screen.....Asus beat it in every categoryBut I needed windows for a particular program for work, so I couldn't use my Chromebook.

Big_dataset_132,Big_dataset,"I'm coming from the Apple world, with a 2011 15"" MacBook Pro. This Chromebook is impressive. It's extremely well built. I ended up returning it and purchasing a new 13"" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, for more than three times the price. You end up giving up a significant amount overall if you go cheap. Here's some comparisons:Keyboard: mushy. I like the new MBP keyboards. I know I'm in the minority. The clickiness is amazing.Touchpad: tiny and not at Apple levels. Gesture support is flaky, whereas Apple's is perfected.Screen: not that bright and it's too wide. The MBP has a great aspect ratio and can blind you indoors if you turn it up too high. Right now it's less than halfway up.Speakers: anemic. The MBP's new speakers are impressive.Camera: both are not good.Integration: if you have an iPhone, you'll get calls on your Mac. If you have an Apple Watch, it'll automatically unlock when you open your Mac's lid. iMessage! Photos! The one cool thing the Asus did was have Android app support. That alone can replace a lot of your phone's functionality, so you can just leave your phone's battery alone.Battery life: both excellent. The MBP is a bit longer though.Build quality: Apple's is unparalleled, but Asus did a great job on this one. You won't feel like you bought something cheap.OS: I program, I make music in Logic. I use 1Password. I like Hearthstone once in a while. Maybe I'll want an eGPU at some point. Outside of Logic and the eGPU, everything is POSSIBLE with the Asus, but it's just not good. Crouton sounds like a good idea, but it's terribly hacky. If you think you'll want to program daily on the Asus, you're going to prove yourself wrong. It's too much work unless you want to use cloud providers. 1Password can be used as an Android app, but it doesn't support browser extensions, so you'll have to copy and paste constantly. Chrome OS touch support is so half-baked.I know what some of you are thinking: this was not the right product for me. You're right. I need more from a laptop. As a last word, I'd put this laptop in the same category of functionality as an iPad. I'd rather have the Asus in that scenario, unless the iPad Pro comes with a keyboard all under $500, which it doesn't. This was a good experiment, but you do end up getting what you pay for. If you have an appreciation for Apple's user experience mastery, you will be disappointed with this one. In that case, spend the money and at least get a MacBook Air.

This is pricier than most chromebooks, but the crisp, hi res screen, the great keyboard, and the highly responsive  touch pad make this definitely worth the extra money.  The touch screen is a nice plus, but it is hardly necessary because the touchpad is so good.Having said that, as  a tablet it leaves a lot to be desired.  In tablet mode it is a bit clunky, with the exposed keys on the back.  Furthermore, the bezels on this screen are pretty wide, and the bezel along the keyboard side is extremely wide, with the top bezel also a bit wider than the short sides.  What this means is that in tablet mode it seems unnaturally long and narrow.  Furthermore, Chrome OS is not really optimized for tablet mode, so I am often aiming my fat fingers at very tiny targets.  If I were rating this as a tablet, I'd give it two or three of five stars.  But I own an iPad, and when I need a tablet, that's what I use.I bought this for its chrome book features, and in that capacity it would be hard to beat this ASUS.  The device is very well built, sturdy but also thin and light.  The keyboard and touch pad a first rate, battery life is extremely long, and screen quality is outstanding.

Every update screws up my Lenovo laptop and I have to trick it into a reset, by pulling out the battery. It's gotten slower and more problematic with every Win 10 update. You know the ""We're going to make Windows better"" scam.Well I finally could not take it any more and was in a toss up between this Asus, and either the Samsung plus or pro. Since I've had an Asus Zenpad 10.1"" android tablet for a few years and could almost just live with that and the Zagg keyboard case I have, I know Asus has a quality product line, and since they provide 64GB of storage and a backlit keyboard on the c302 for less than Samsung's 32GB and nonlit keys Chromebook plus and pro, that just made my choice.I've had my C302 for about 24 hrs and I already have it just how I like it and feel familiar with the UI out of the box.

I'm used to using Google Docs for my writing and on one project I'm writing with someone else, I can share the files easily with my co-writer with no emailing or attachments. We each use a different ink color so we can easily scan to see if there are additions or edits from the other person.Some Android apps are still 'sticky' on the Chrome OS. Don't expect Instagram to work as it seems to crash and result in a restart, but I expect these things to get worked out down the road.So far, I feel liberated by my switch to Chrome. My Windows laptop will get stripped down of all my personal files and pictures via Google drive and Photos and will be a dedicated Chromecast streaming device and nothing more.

The chromebook also comes with a touch screen and completely foldable keyboard so that you can use it as a tablet. My disappointment begins with the fact that chromeOS is not touch-ready and most websites will not consider touch interface for desktop mode websites. Google's own services like google docs, drive, and gmail don't respond well to touch screen gestures often leaving me in despair. For example you cannot scroll the slides preview frame while creating or a presentation in google docs. You have to use the mouse or try and grab that small scrollbar on the screen.Second issue is with scaling of the UI. The screen itself is HD 1080p but most UI elements don't look good in this resolution. This forces you to move to a lower resolution but now you can't watch YouTube videos in 1080p.Third issue is that I was expecting google drive to act like a file system for all the installed apps. But this is far from the truth. Unless the app is specifically designed to access google drive files, the app has no way to read and save files directly to the cloud. I struggle to setup my password manager to save files on the google drive. I had to save the working files in temporary or secondary storage. So no synchronization for me.

I plan to take it with me when working as I have gotten approximately 8-9 hrs of battery time usage so far.This is my first chromebook so I am still learning the ins and outside but am very impressed with the whole package.

Big_dataset_177,Big_dataset,"The delivery was all over the place which made me mad as hell. But once I got the device, oh boy was it worth the wait.This thing would equal or rival a Macbook in appearance even with a somewhat similar design language. It is remarkably fast on Chrome OS and the screen is very clear (but glossy). Battery life appears to be pretty good too. I guess the only thing I could complain about it is the spotty sound quality and to a smaller degree Chrome OS.Chrome has come a long way to be sure and in its optimized avatar on this system its very snappy. Even playing Full HD and 4k videos is buttery smooth (even though 4k would only render at 1080p of course, just making the point that system, network and display speed are all top notch). The keyboard is also very comfortable to type on.So I come from an ASUS UX305FA which has a 4k screen but a similar M3 processor (its one generation behind but benchmarks put them roughly on par still). I thought there was no way in hell I was going to give up that system and my beloved 4k screen, but this system, being a tad smaller, actually renders usable content pretty much as clearly as you would need it.Now my only curiosity is if it lasts. I have heard reports of the hardware being unreliable but I'm crossing my fingers!*UPDATE*About a month later I noticed a small spec on the screen. It was difficult to spot initially but got progressively more prominent. It was a dead pixel. So as I feared, within a few months the device had already started acting up. I took it to the ASUS service center and they discovered 2-3 more dead pixels that I hadn't spotted. But they replaced the screen free of charge. Notched down the 5 stars to 4 and even though ASUS did a pretty solid job of repairing it, I'm going to reserve judgement on this device for a bit longer.This is in no way a testament to the brand mind you. My other ASUS laptop has lasted > 4 years now and still going strong (it got a bit dis-coloured on the body which is expensive to replace, but other than that its fine).

Big_dataset_235,Big_dataset,"I just received it yesterday so I will have to update my review after some time passes. But, here’s some insight I can give to a first time chromebook user:- It is an adjustment from PC or Mac. I’ve had both a PC and a Mac in the past and I would definitely say the chromebook is it’s own thing, although if I had to choose I would say it’s closer to a windows 10 setup. If you are someone set in your ways this is not for you. However, if you are someone like me who adapts fairly easily to technology and doesn’t mind spending an afternoon figuring stuff out then go for it.- While the chromebook is suppose to be a hybrid between a tablet and a laptop that is internet based, I would have to say it leans more toward the tablet spectrum. All your programs are apps from the google play store.- I need to update my review about file storing, printing, and Microsoft compatibility once I explore these areas more. However, I was able to download Microsoft Office apps easily.- I was worried that because the chromebooks are internet based it would run slow, but so far it is very fast at processing, installing, and uploading things.- Physically it is appealing looking. (Some of these “rugged” chromebooks look like they’re made for children.) This is smart looking, thin, light weight, and portable. The size makes it look more of like a lab top then a tablet although I would say it’s configured more like a tablet or phone with an App Store.- Finally, I think this one is kind of obvious given I was able to test it out.

I didn't want a bulky laptop nor did I want to deal with Windows OS.After purchasing, this Chromebook came with me on a 2 week trip to China.  It is very lightweight, log-on screen comes up within a nano-second of opening the lid. The keyboard has a nice quiet touch. It fit nicely into my backpack without taking up space or weighing me down.Note - can't watch  Gogo inflight movies, at least not on UAL. It kept saying turn-off airplane mode.  Well, there isn't one on a Chromebook or any laptop for that matter.  Just confirmed with Gogo Support - Chromebooks are not supported.Oh well,  that a Gogo limitation, not a problem with the functionality of the ASUS Chromebook.  I'll just load my movies on a USB and away I go!

Big_dataset_246,Big_dataset,"This is my second Chromebook and I have owned this one for almost a year. Performance wise, this is an excellent machine - it has a beautiful touchscreen, plenty of storage, converts to a tablet, and seamlessly connects to the Google Play Store to run any of the millions of Android apps available. I decided to write this review now due to events that have transpired over the last couple of weeks. While opening the device one day, the ""lid"" buckled and cracked resulting in a ruined screen on the inside (cracked and full of black pixels). Needless to say, I was SICK! I contacted ASUS to inquire about warranty repair and dealt with a very pleasant woman on the phone who instructed me as to the steps needed to send the device in. After receiving a shipping label emailed from ASUS, I packed the device up and sent it in, worrying about how long it may take to get repaired (some reviewers have stated that months passed without hearing anything). Within 2 days, I received notification that the device was received and being evaluated. Five days later, I received an email stating that the device was repaired and being returned to me. Today I received it and it looks brand new! The customer/warranty service that I received was first class and I am very impressed by ASUS for this reason alone. I use this Chromebook daily and look forward to much continued usage. If you are in need of a reliable laptop that is lightweight, fast, and convertible, I highly recommend the ASUS C302!

Big_dataset_265,Big_dataset,"I'm a longtime Macbook Pro user and I'm used to top quality build in the products I've owned. I wanted to jump into the world of Chome OS to have a lightweight, portable laptop or tablet with full browser functions. I considered the MacBook Air and the Microsoft Surface, but went with this convertible because Chrome OS works better for my needs for working on the road.PROS:IMMEDIATE ACCOUNT SET UP and ONLINE ACCESS - Chrome OS is brilliant at finding and integratign with your Google profile via you Gmail account if you have one (I do, and use Google Apps for all of our online email, calendar and contact functions with a custom domain). So it was literally open the convertible and there was all my information like I'd been using it for a year or more. That alone made me happy with my decision to go with Chrome OS.GREAT PRODUCT BUILD - The quality of this ASUS Chromebook is impressive at any price, but at sub-$500 it's astounding. I feel like I'm working on a top end Apple product. The metal case is really well built, and the fit and finish are virtually perfect. The convertible hinge system is really solid feeling, and automatically converts the laptop into a tablet when it's swung 180 degres to the flipped position. The keyboard is excellent, if a little shallow on the key throw for a touch typist, which I am, but I can type a full speed nonetheless. The trackpad is response and accurate. And, I love the backlit keys as well.The battery performance is all it's cracked up to be ... all day long. I've got at least 10 hours with a bunch of tabs open and working all day on various projects. That alone puts it in the top of the class for a portable.CONS:The screen is bright and the colors are saturated, but' s not an Apple Retina screen by anyone's stretch of imagination. It is however good enough to do any kind of online work or to watch videos and movies, but don't expect high quality HD, and you'll see a few frame drops even at 300MPS download, which I'm running.The sound is rich and plenty loud enough, but it won't replace your music system. What's most noticibly missing are the rich bass tones.The camera for webcasts or video conferencing is defintely good enough as well, but again it's not full HD, so the image is grainy compared to the 1080 webcams I'm used to using.All in all if you get what Chromebook OS is all about this is an excellent purchase that I think you will be thoroughly pleased with owning and using if it suits your needs. That said just buy it with confidence, it's a top quality product all around, and, it looks and feels that way.

Big_dataset_272,Big_dataset,"My very first Chromebook was the original Asus flip. And it was love at first use. I loved the simplicity of Chrome OS while enjoying the flip aspect of being able to turn it into a reading tablet when I wanted to as well. Nevertheless, I did have my own nitpicking issues with it but for the $250 price tag it launched with, it was well worth it.This time around, Asus released an absolutely refined masterpiece. The C302 is heavier in size and appearance and also significantly better in all aspects.  And while this technically was the follow up to the original Flip, as Alex reviewed early this year, the C101PA is the true successor to that line.  What we have here is a totally superior older brother of sorts.The touch screen on this Chromebook is responsive and fits into a 12.5 inch frame with a resolution of 1920 x 1080p. I found the display to be very vibrant, with excellent pixel density.The keyboard traction is clicky and the layout is spaced out well enough for a terrific typing experience. The trackpad has plenty of space to move around with your fingers, and nothing feels too cramped. On a regular basis, I’m able to type on the Chromebook very comfortably using Google docs and editing Google sheets.One of my favorite aspects of the previous Chromebook flip was being able to use it as a comfortable reading device in bed. I’m a little clumsier with this one, considering it’s larger size and heavier weight, but it’s still usable nonetheless. It can function as a browsing tablet, but it honestly isn’t meant to operate as one no matter how much these OEMs want to use it as a selling point.On the sides of the flip, you’ll find a power button, volume rocker, microphone slot, micro SD slot, and two USB-C ports. I like the dispersion of ports and feel it helps with the ergonomics of your daily usage.  Since the chromebook charges via USB-C, this makes it very convenient to carry around with any other modern devices you may have that use USB-C as well.There are also small speakers on each side of the bottom edges.  The speakers themselves are just average, but loud enough if you’re just looking to play some music or watch videos. I’ve also tested out the webcam a few times on here, and it’s not fantastic, but does the job.On the inside of the chromebook, you’ll find the Intel Core m3 chip as a processor for the base model. While I don’t usually run anything intensive on Chrome OS to begin with, I have yet to stumble across any lag or stuttering with the chromebook. Even with multiple apps running, it continues to run smoothly. I’ve downloaded multiple apps on the Google Play store and have yet to experience huge skips, even when playing more intensive games.  As with what we’ve seen on other Chromebooks, Intel Core M processors aren’t the most optimal for Android but it sure helps pack a punch for everything else on Chrome OS.One of the biggest downsides though, to this Chromebook is the battery life. If I’m just browsing the internet, even on a lower screen brightness, I get about 6 hours of battery life. While that’s about average for most laptops, I would’ve wished for slightly better battery life, especially because I use my chromebook for more day to day leisure activities as opposed to work intensive usage.  I’ve had to charge this at airports and while traveling more than I’d like to especially when put up against other laptops and 2-in-1’s we’ve tested.Still, for $450 I’m a huge fan of the screen and the excellent overall build quality. The premium feel combined with the charming simplicity of Chrome OS really gives it a stunning experience. And even with all of the new competition hitting the market with higher price points, the C302 still offers the best premium Chrome OS experience at a respectable price.

I would consider you as someone who could get the most out of a higher end CB, so this is my recommendation.I owned a couple Surface Pro 4s before, but from the day I got the ASUS I haven't even powered them up.  (I sold them in fact).  The ASUS is powerful enough to stream video, I watch TV on it, do all my Google Trainer work with it, and all my daily work too.  I have never had the processor give a hint that I was asking something it couldn't handle, and this is with tons of tabs opened too.  I love the fact that the battery is good for at least 2 days, and I don't have to wait for Windows to boot up every time I open the lid.  Let's see, what else????  The fact that I can flip it into tablet is cool, the audio is decent, I love the feel of the keyboard,  I didn't think touch screen was a big deal, but I use it all the time now with joy,  ya....I am in love with it.The only hassle I have found is that it lacks an HDMI port.  That was resolved with an adapter for HDMI (and one for old-school USB), but that isn't a big deal.From my perspective it is worth every penny I paid, and then some.  I used to worry that Chromebooks were a little underpowered for my work, but not anymore.  Give the ASUS Flip 302 consideration.  I would recommend it 100% (or maybe more).

I wanted something with a bigger screen and a keyboard, but that could still be used as a ""Tablet"".  At first I was totally stoked on this chromebook.  The fit and finish if pretty good.  Aluminum outer body, usb C charging from either side of the chrombooke, backit keyboard, nice screen resolution and fast processor.  Plastic inner body, but  because the plastic isn't cold when resting your hands to type, unlike say a macbook where resting your hands to type is resting on ice cold aluminum.Anyhow, within a week, the speakers started crackling annyoingly when watching videos, or playing games.  It would go away with a re-boot, but then slowly come back after a while.  Then about 3 months in, it quit charging from the supplied fast charger.  It would charge only from my phone charger, so I did that for a bit.  I contacted Asus and they suggested a full refresh.  That worked and everything was back to normal for about a month.  Then I one night I plugged it in and woke up to a dead chromebook. I treid the full reboot and it seemed to fix it a agian.  But now, no matter hw many re-freshes I do, it will only start charging if I have the screen open and the chromebook woken up from sleep.  I can plug it in and put it back to sleep and it will charge, but if I haven't woken it up it won't begin to charge.  It's a bit annoying to have to remember to wake it up before plugging in to charge.  It definetly wasn't that way out of the box.The speaker crackling I can live with as I just need to logout and re-log in to fix it for about a week. The charging issue I can live with as well, even though it is annoying.  But honestly this premium priced and premium styled chromebook is a bit of a let down as my sons Acer r11 has held up much better over the 2 years hes had it, while this one at almost twice the price has had annyoing little issues.I would look elsewhere for a convertible chrombook, this one just doesn't quite live up expectactions.

Once I got it set up, using the google app required by the device to set up a child's account, I was surprised to find that the app isn't compatible with the play store and so it basically defeats the purpose of the child having the device because she is unable to download any apps.  Minecraft is also not available for this device.  I give it 4 stars because I believe that these devices are perfect for adults who just want to surf the internet or watch netflix.  Hopefully they will add the features need to make the app work correctly and work out some type of pocket edition for minecraft.

Big_dataset_307,Big_dataset,"I could rate it lower because of some difficulty establishing a printing protocol at my office, but that is an inherent issue  with Chrome, not Asus.I really like the keyboard. The keyboard and display quality have always been Asus strengths in my experience. Overall build is solid. Having to use USB-C adapters for some devices is a bit of a drag, but when buying a Chromebok I knew I was not buying a fully accommodating laptop, and certainly not for the price.Earlier models apparently required switching to a beta screen to accept Android apps. I pleasantly surprised I could just raise a separate screen that had apps already installed. I installed several more and it was a totally transparent process.The touchpad is not the best, but it is not that terrible either. I am not fond of touchpads anyway, so probably not the best one to judge them.If I can get it print in our office without using another powered on PC as server through Chrome (which does work) I wold rate it a 5.

It came in a lovely cardboard box with stickers to adorn and personalize the machine but the novelty wore off quickly. It was 2010 and we were only 3 years removed from the launch of the first truly portable smart device. WiFi hotspots were but few and far between and the idea of using a laptop without anything actually installed on it was novel but far ahead of its time.The CR-48 became relegated to simple browsing with the real computing done by my MacBook Pro or my wife's HP laptop. When it started having issues it was tossed aside without another thought. Eventually, I would abandon my Apple fancy and move back into the Windows ecosystem. When it came time to get a new laptop I went with a high-end gaming machine from MSI which was fantastic for a year or so but became out-dated far too quickly. After a few years it began to show its age and I started looking for a new laptop. Initially, I was drawn to similar machines but the reality of my uses was stark - I wasn't using the laptop for gaming and if I wanted to get back into PC games I knew the best route would be through a custom built desktop rig not some form-factor laptop which would become obsolete before the shine was even starting to fade.I'm an avid consumer of tech news so I had stayed up-to-date with the latest of Google Chome OS but after my first foray I was hesitant; could the experience really have changed all that much? Add to that their low-price point and meager specs and it seemed like these were great machines for other people but I would need a 'real' computer. I was able to hobble my old MSI laptop forward for a few more months in which time I really spent time looking at how I used my laptop and what I needed from a new one.Most of my laptop use comes down to internet use. I was already doing 95% of everything through a browser with a few stand-alone apps making up the rest (including Discord and Spotify) so in terms of pure usage I realized I could probably get by with a Chromebook but the quality and specs worried me. The more I considered it though, the more I came to believe that a Chromebook would be a good choice for me for the time.I read through consumer and professional reviews of the different models and came to the conclusion that the Google Pixelbook would be the machine for me. It was up-scale with good specs and while it was at the top-end of the price spectrum for Chromebooks that set it apart. Finally, after hearing me muse about these things for months my wife jumped in to ask a very good question: Is the Pixelbook truly worth almost twice the price of the second-best rated Chromebook - the ASUS Chromebook Flip C302? The specs definitely were a huge upgrade but dollar-for-dollar she had a point. I'm not one to have an excessive number of Chrome tabs open; I like my screen to be clean and crisp so what would that extra power do for me?The keyboard and mouse on the ASUS were frequently rated as good but those on the Pixelbook were raved about. Again, I turned to my wife who pointed out that these reviews are from people who spend their lives literally pouring over the minutia of these machines. They can tell the difference between a decent keyboard and a good keyboard but would I be able to? I like to think I'm a connoisseur but the truth is that I doubted I could. In the end, I bit the bullet and took her advice. Two days later, I had my new Chromebook.It was an epiphany. I had read dozens of reviews over and again so I knew - or thought I knew - everything about the Flip. I was wrong. This computer was 10 fold what I had expected. Truthfully, I thought I could get by with it as a machine but I never thought I would fall in love - let alone completely head-over-heels for the little thing. Years ago, I had a 8"" Dell Windows tablet that I had used for a lot of similar purposes but here all of those long-forgotten uses were brought back to the forefront.Open the machine up, check my email and calendar, look at Discord, respond to texts via Android Messages for Web. Flip the screen around and read some news comfortably or open up the Kindle app and read a book. It is wonderful.If you're on the fence about getting a Chromebook my best advice is to go for it. Don't be fooled by the specs on these machines - they're plenty powerful for whatever you might want to do with it. They aren't without limitations, to be sure, but give one a chance before you rule it out.

Big_dataset_387,Big_dataset,"I'll preface this with the good before I chime in on the not so good.  I purchased this based on reviews from industry websites early this year. Even just this last month it still rates (on several tech sites) as one of the best overall Chromebook lines to get.  The machine is easy to use, snappy, and everything the reviewers say.  The main bad for this particular variant is that Google is no longer going to support it with updates.  It must have officially reach ""end of life"" as my last check on the update tab was greeted by a message that it will no longer get updates and I should consider buying newer hardware.  So be forwarded, if you buy this, you are jumping right into a machine that won't get updates anymore (which is something most Chromebook owners want and a feature that makes them better than Android and it's fragmented market).In hindsight I'm more OK with swapping a phone every couple years than I am a laptop just to keep the system up-to-date, so I'll be heading back to Apple OS or Windows OS since those will keep updating on hardware past the 5 yr (and more) mark.*** Update 7/20/2018I double checked the Google site about product releases, and I did see a line about the C302 mentioned in the feedback. I waited before updating my review to see if the update message was an anomaly (I am at release 67.0.3396.99) - however I got the warning again today that I will no longer be receiving updates.  I'll attempt a post to release support, but so far not looking promising.  I'll update this review again once I get more information.

The Chrome OS works quickly and lacks unnecessary fluff that other operating systems have a tendency to carry with them.

Even with the volume turned up all the way, the sound is very low which means that you have a poor soundstage. I tried it with efficient, good quality earbuds and headphones (Sennheiser HD 1 earbuds and Grado SR 60 headphones). I then tried the Sennheisers and Grados on another, much cheaper chromebook (a Toshiba) and it was able to drive them to a decent level. I have now hooked up an external headphone amp (a Schiit fulla connected via a minijack audio cable) and the volume level is very good.I care about my music and this laptop does not cut it unless you are willing to buy a separate headphone amp. That's nutty for an expensive premium product. My cheap samsung android phone does a better job of driving my sennheiser HD 1 earbuds than the ASUS laptop does> This is also a known problem if you search this but unfortunately I found this out after I bought the product.ASUS what the heck were you thinking when you designed this product?I seriously love the product but I may have to return it.

It does support the newest AC network, but you need a router that supports that and AC only works on the 5ghz band. This chromebook uses both 2.4 or 5ghz. It found and connected to my wireless printer also with no problems. Overall, this Asus flip works in all positions, laptop, presentation, tent and tablet with touchscreen working in any position. Highly recommend this unit. Very very nice unit. We love it.

I've had two of these chromebooks now and they both have the same issue with white light bleeding from the corners.Great overall chromebook. Only gripe is mine came with what looked like a warped screen/lid. When I closed the screen it had a large noticeable gap. The middle sections on the sides were not touching the base or the small runner tabs. I had to physically bend the aluminum lid to make it sit flush. Not sure if this is a common issue but it kind of ruined my first experience with it.

In my opinion, a Chromebook is like a giant smartphone with a keyboard, it does everything an android phone does but nothing more. There is an option to download Microsoft Office, however it has extremely limited functionality. All of the features you find in normal Microsoft office just aren't there. Then again, I know people who swear by google docs and sheets, but again, not as much functionality as Office. Furthermore, the file system is extremely complicated to use. Whenever I send an email, the only folder that is available as an attachment is the ""Downloads"" folder. Thus, I purposely saved all of my work to that folder just to be able to email them. I don't understand why they invest any high end hardware into Chromebooks, because there isn't an app on the google play store that could use that hardware.Bottom line: If you plan on doing any heavy coursework that you would normally use a normal computer, for this isn't for you.

Does what I need it to do.  Very portable.  Only problem I have had, which was from the moment I started using it is the audio.  First the volume does not get very loud.  I plugged in regular headphones and it was horribly low - very unenjoyable to listen to music this way...Thank god I was able to connect my bluetooth headphones and that was BETTER but not perfect....at least the volume through bluetooth was tolerable.  In addition, every so often (with or without headphones) it makes a crackling noise.  I think it must be a defective audio part or connection somewhere inside BUT when I think about calling the company while it is under warranty, I dread the thought of having to be without it until they fix it or send me a new one.  Right now Id rather live with the problem then be without it...I just hope it doesnt get worse.

Big_dataset_514,Big_dataset,"Hardware is excellent, chromeOS is very bad. The build quality is awesome. Aluminum shell looks very nice, just like a macbook. The 1080p touchscreen also looks good. The keyboard is terrific. The feeling of typing is even slightly better than my lenovo t440s. battery is good with 8 hours plus use time (browsing internet). There is no fan, absolutely quiet. The laptop CPU speed is good, no lag at all. The 64GB harddrive is big enough (you can't really install anything big). 4GB of memory is enough (you can't really run anything except Chrome browser). The only thing I would complain about the hardware is the keyboard layout. There is no capslock, but you get a search key there. This is really annoying. There is no delete key, but I could live without it.The chromeOS really sucks. There are too many inconveniences. You can'd do this. You can't do that. It is horrible and it could not complete some basic tasks. Let me tell you the followings. Your logon password must be your gmail password, which is long and you have to type it every time you log on. The WORD from playstore is buggy. It often crashes or not responsive. If you use WORD to open files on onedrive directly, it will not responsive and froze and must be forced close absolutely for sure. You can't open two WORD files at the same time. Don't tell me to use the WORD online. The file looks different and the word online is just not fully compatible with WORD desktop.You can't sync your dropbox files. There is no offline copies of your files at all, because it is only supported by a third-party interface. Even if you can have a 200GB microSD, it has no use, because there is no sync. It does not support OneDrive business. There is a beta version for OneDrive business, but I never make it work. Always not responsive (report that action takes too long).It does not support NAS, so I could not access any files on my WD NAS. Your media player will have no use, and you can only stream.When you close the lid, it will go to sleep. The battery will not last more than 3 days in sleep. This is totally unacceptable, as I never turn off my ipad and it will last almost forever if not in use. To save the battery, you have to turn chromebook off. You can't even set it to turn off automatically when you close the lid. A quite stupid design.Yes, you can install apps from playstore, but those apps are not designed for chromebook. They all have tiny screens and you can't adjust its size. Some can be maximized but you just can't let it take half of the screen. Either tiny or full screen, oh crap. Moreover, you have to restart the app to switch between tiny and full screen.All I can do with Chromebook is to use chrome browser. Except that, nothing. I think chromeOS is not well supported by mainstream software developers, and there is a long way to go for ChromeOS. If WIN10 can be installed on this machine, it will be great. ChromeOS ruins the laptop.

The second is also a known trouble spot with Android, and that is the microSD card.  Some apps can access it, some can't.

Big_dataset_529,Big_dataset,"UPDATE: This is a sad, sad day. Running ChromeOS 70 now, and it's great!  Very fast, responsive, lots of Android apps up and going. But ... I'm sad. I took my Chromebook to work, put it in a padded sleeve, put that in a backpack and off I went. The backpack was on a chair, accidentally got knocked off. I wasn't too worried because the Chromebook was in a sleeve ... and it's aluminum, too!  But ... yep, you guessed it. It was damaged. The keyboard frame is still plastic, and not a very durable plastic at that. I am now the not-so-proud owner of a wonder Chromebook with a sizeable crack in the lower left corner. Sizeable. Noticeable. Disappointing!  Why bother with aluminum if it's cheapo plastic that can't take a padded drop.  Aaaargh. Machine still runs great, a little scar isn't going to change my thoughts about it. Just disappointed, that's all.UPDATE: Have had this puppy now for several months ... my opinion has changed dramatically! This is a really nice laptop ... really nice! It's running Chrome 67 now, and purrs like a kitten. Fast, beautiful display, comfortable keyboard, and the Android apps work well (not great yet, but well). I'm basically using this as a Chromebook, not taking advantage of the flip and Android apps, and this alone makes me happy! I am a big ChromeOS fan ... it's grown up so nicely, so very useful!! Eventually, I would expect the Android side to catch up and work as well as they do on my LG smartphone and Asus 10 tablet (both are excellent!).----I am sad to write this review ... I had high expectations for the C302. Sorry for the ""downer"" start here, because as a Chromebook, the C302 is very good. Not excellent, but the best among the 7 Chromebooks I own. Yes, I am up to my 7th Chromebook. BTW, even the lowest priced Chromebook (about $150) is good ... just slower at doing what it does. the C302 is fast ... but buggy. I had hoped, with the addition of Android apps, that it would be both a Chromebook and an Android tablet. With future upgrades, perhaps that will still happen. But I write this review just after I have turned off the Android side of this laptop. It is NOT a replacement for a good tablet (such as the 10 inch ASUS ... outstanding tablet, BTW!! Really outstanding!). The C302 m5 (the best processor I could find so far, is a very good Chromebook. It is fast, but it is ... quirky. All of sudden, out of nowhere, it just ... blips. Perhaps I'm tapping the touchpad by mistake (don't think so) ... that would explain the random jaunts around the screen. So ... I've only had this honey for a few days now. I'm going to play around more with it and see ... is it operator error, or does it really have a mind of its own. I will update this review when I have more experience. On the plus side, it is fast ... very responsive! I am a big Chromebook fan ... I am biased, but I'm also fair. Pains me greatly not to report that this is an excellent machine.So, after more use, guess what I found! (Oh, go ahead and guess!) When the screen is flipped 360 to turn the C302 into a tablet, the keyboard is disabled as you'd expect so when you put it on your lap, your knees are not typing by mistake! Except ... not all of the keyboard buttons are disabled. The up/down/right/left keys and some of the top row function keys are still active. So when I put it on my lap, my knees actually were having somewhat random impacts on the screen!  Hmmm. Well, now that I found that out, I can be more careful. Still, a very nice compact Chromebook ... with quirks.

Big_dataset_530,Big_dataset,"This is a very cleverly designed and fast machine.Pros:1.  Operational speed--likely the fastest laptop I have ever used (for basic functions).2.  Boot speed: likewise, very fast--boot speed is quicker than some other devices' ""wake from sleep"" speed3.  Screen quality: it is just classic hi-def, at 1080p. but it looks like a higher res. screen somehow.  I also like that it is 16:9.4.  a great, lit keyboard, which many laptops in this price range do not have5.  Folds nicely into a very sturdy-feeling tablet; Android reading apps come in handy here6.  battery life that rivals a good tablet's--it can last up to ten hours, in use, on one charge7.  mixed blessing dept.: it is open to Android apps via Google play; some apps (like Moon + Reader) work fine, others, like Amazon Video, do not work well as they were designed for mobile environments, and Chrome is not exactly Android 6.0--so android apps are hit-or-miss, not a cinch, on this Chromebook.  Many android apps work conditionally: e.g., ES File tree manager works well, but it won't access the SD card slot, though it will access clouds.Cons:1.  The big one: it lacks a really good Word Processor on the Chromebook side.  I don't want to type every document directly into a google cloud, thanks (google docs).  Microsoft apparently strategically breaks (slows down, makes subtly crazy, etc.) the version of Word that can function on Android, for Chromebooks. There are various Android word processors--but they operate more like provisional items, like a non-inflatable spare tire, than a real word processor most of the Android Word Processeors restrict the kinds of fonts available in an attempt to provoke users to buy fonts, rights, or subscriptions, while still not allowing custom fonts.  No thanks.  Andr""open"" Office Writer (a version of Libre Writer for Android) used to be buggy--I am trying it again, and it seems better--maybe it not bad for light work on the Chromebook side.)2. There is no way to equalize sound on the Chromebook side--some android music players have a built in EQ that may work, but device-wide android EQs do not work very well, or only very selectively.  I (and many others!) really want a nice device-wide sound EQ for Chromebook3.  trade off department: the Chrome desktop always stays empty--unlike Windows or Android, there's no desktop with icons on it, just a nice wallpaper image of your choice.  There is only an app drawer and a task-bar of recent items.  The benefits of this sacrifice are speed and better battery life, I imagine.  I'm fine with this eccentricity, but be aware of this difference of Chrome and other systems.The workaround:One can install a Linux operating system  that works in parallel with the Chrome system.  One enters Linux via a terminal screen that looks like a DOS screen in a chain bookstore's computer in 1989; I am not sure why someone hasn't invented an app that works more like a switch, but Ok.  Once you memorize the programmer's strings to get you over to the Linux system, it only takes a minute, and with Crouton one can switch back and forth between Linux and Chrome in a few key strokes, once Linux is engaged.  Finding a Linux version that works best for you is a tinker-er's problem, too. I use a version of XFCE, which is a lighter weight Linux OS.  The ""heavier"" ones didn't work, in my experience.  I installed Linux almost entirely to use LibreOffice word processor, a big, serious, free alternative to Word that works in Linux as well as it does in Windows.Linux in itself works well but equipping a Linux work environment can be tedious.  There are typically ultimate solutions to most problems, but because there are so many variables involving a) varieties of Linux and b) machines, practical problems like installing a Bluetooth adapter/ manager can be a long chore involving lots of experiment based on uncertain advice given in Linux forums.  Remember, Linux is a decentralized enterprise, so there are few central solutions.  Linux is not a Ford Model A; it is a series of cars built by users with prototypes.  Some functions that might seem plausible in Linux--like playing a DVD with VLC--are just not possible, and have long records of trial and, mostly, error, in forums.There are likely some other, clever things that one could also do on the Linux side, but I am not a full-on Linux guy and use it mostly for LibreOffice.  The other apps I would be most tempted to try on the Linux side are sound, photo, and video editors.

My favorite music and eBook reader software can't use sdCard for storage. From looking articles up on the web, the Chrome team has decided that on cellphones, sdCards are hard to take out, so they can safely consider them ""permanent storage"" so the system provides a file path that apps can use to find your music, movies, whatever. But on a Chromebook, the sdCard is so easy to pop in and out that they consider it ""temporary storage"" and they WILL NOT provide a file path to folders on the card for apps to use to access it directly. There fear is that people will pop out the cards without closing files, apps will crash, data will be lost and users will be coming after them with torches and pitchforks. Some apps like VLC for Android can be used to play movies on the sdCard using the File App and opening the movie from there.This machine came with 64GB of ""hard disk"" storage.

Having 2 usb-c ports is really helpful because it allows me to plug in an accessory and charge it at the same time.As for the performance, it can handle a lot! I am known for having way too many tabs open in chrome and this thing handles them with ease. Once in a while, it will bog down, but it is usually when I haven't restarted it in over a week. Speaking of restarts, it boots up in seconds, so doing a quick restart is not painful at all.

Big_dataset_556,Big_dataset,"Chromebooks take some getting used to, but, with this one, the journey has  been a smooth one.  I'm giving it four stars only because I have had it for just two months and I expect it to serve for three or more years.  I'll let you know how that goes.  I bought this mostly for traveling and having some control over what I watch on an airplane.  It's possible, given what sort of space you get on most flights these days, that it may be a little too big.  My main criterion for size was that it had to fit comfortably in the bag my son gave me and this does, a little better than my X230 think Pad did.  But, I wanted as big a screen as would fit and this Chromebook is great for that, much higher resolution than the think Pad and very crisp and bright (if you turn it up a lot).  It's still a little cumbersome when the guy in front of slams his seat back into your face,  but flipping it to tablet mode and setting it just to the side of the lap table, so there's still room for your drink, works.The coolest thing is the touch screen on something this size.  The only problem is that I'm already trying to touch the screen on other displays that just aren't there yet.  Depending on the resolution you choose, things can get pretty small and, where a mouse click would be nothing, your finger can have trouble.  I'm using one notch down from the ASUS recommended 1920x1080 and that makes touching the right spot and getting the desired response a little easier but I'm older than all computers and have to make accommodations that you might not.  I've been using a Bluetooth mouse and it works well but, it's still quicker to just reach out and press some button than to use the mouse.Another cool thing is that you can install many Android apps if you have a fairly recent release of the Chrome OS, which this one has and, I suspect, most Chromebooks will have soon  .  So far, Netflix has been the most useful for me.  They will let you download a subset of their movies so you can watch them offline.  You have to sign up for the streaming service ($12/mo., cancelable any time) and not using a normal computer. I select the standard resolution which, on this size screen, is fine and a typical movie takes less than a gigabyte.  If you have Amazon Prime, you can install their Android video app and download selected movies for no extra cost.  And then, watch them all anywhere with no network worries.You will wind up buying some adapters and attachments until the whole world is on USB  C and then you'll have to start getting adapters for whatever follows it  I have a USB C cable with micro-USB on the other end.  Then I can use one of the ASUS ports to charge a real phone, but not very fast. I also have a small box with three USB 3 ports and slots for both flavors of SD chips and a short cable that plugs into one of the USB C ports.  The ASUS has only two USB C ports but they are both the same and they do everything.Most current printers with wi-fi will connect to this Chromebook and it will connect to a google Cloud Printer, a real printer connected to a computer that's anywhere, presumably close enough to you to do some good.The ASUS C302 costs a little more than lots of 12.5 inch Chromebooks but it offers a lot more, quality, a good back-lit keyboard, a 64GB option, a tiny charger that still charges from empty to full in less than an hour, a micro-SD slot and the fantastic screen.I like this thing a lot and I hope I don't leave it on some plane.

I tried everything, checking and re-checking, visiting help sites and forums, but to no avail! I kept on looking for a solution, but it proved fruitless. After a week of disappointments, frustration and stress, I almost resigned to the fact that the Asus Chromebook flip C302CA was not designed for Android apps.Today was a eureka day- suddenly all my updates began to download! I couldn't believe it- I then attempted to download an app of my choice and it worked! At last!

This little silver bullet is compact, functional, and has held up to everything I've thrown at it.

Also great for streaming media like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Pandora, etc. The reason for a 4 star rating is due to the provided power cord failing to charge within two months. Easy enough fix (just bought a new power cord) but it was reminiscent of horrendous issues I had with my previous ASUS laptop.I was reluctant to purchase anything made by ASUS after having purchased an ASUS Republic of Gamers gaming laptop in 2011 that was anything but inexpensive and nothing but trouble - near constant graphics card issues, keyboard backlighting going out (3x), and ultimately power cord connectivity issues that (like the keyboard backlighting) I had repaired three times at $150 a pop each time only to recur until I eventually scrapped the laptop.Here’s hoping this little bugger continues to hit above its weight class.

Big_dataset_575,Big_dataset,"Perfect for what I need. The nice thing about ChromeOS is that is it idiot proof. Just about everything is backed up online, and the machines are rock solid. This runs everything Chrome pretty fast, and never heats up. The fit and finish is on par to any Mac I've seen. It has 2 usb c ports, which I have used with HDMI and VGA connectors, as well as as few other dongles. Battery life on this seems to be almost as advertised, although it seems to take a hit with the more Android apps I put on here. Boot up is of course, almost instant.Really, the question is do you want to pay this much for a Chomebook when many of them can be had for almost half the cost? One of the reasons I purchased this model about a year ago was that it was one of a few that would support the Google Play Store. Being able to run android apps, greatly improves the functionality of a Chromebook. Nowadays, many models support Android apps, so this may not be a factor in purchasing this model.Another reason that I looked to this Chromebook was because of the USB-C ports, and most importantly, USB-C charging. I liked the idea of everything moving towards USB-C and being able to find a charger in an emergency. Also, being able to use the same charger for my phone and laptop, means that I have to pack one less charger when I travel.At the end of the day I think it is worth the extra cost if you are looking for a premium product feel. If you are the type of person that is willing to shell out a few extra bucks for a nice fit and finish, this is right up your alley. If you are the type of person that just wants to spend the minimum amount of money to get the job done, and do not mind the inconvenience of a proprietary charger and having to use usb-c dongles in the future, then this may not be a good fit for you.

I was tired of the Microsoft PC bs...... constant updating, fear based marketing about viruses, slow start up and being hounded about purchasing new software and updating.  Years ago I switched from Apple to Android phones and became familiar with the Google products (great products and mostly free).  The last straw with my Microsoft 10 laptop was a Microsoft update (I was not offered a choice to update) to Windows 10 that the laptop never recovered from even after a trip to the local PC repair shop.  I have had my ASUS Chromebook for several months and feel liberated from electronic hell.  It is great quality.  It starts almost instantly, the battery lasts all day, it's fast, it updates easily (and for free), it runs all the Android Apps (although I don't find I need them because I just go to the full websites), and it doesn't require anti-virus software (Google Chrome keeps you safe - so I cancelled my $100/yr anti-virus software).

Big_dataset_588,Big_dataset,"I have 3 use cases that I purchased this to fill.  I wanted a lightweight notebook with a large enough keyboard to type for the applications (chrome and android) that involve doing more typing.  I wanted a small notebook that could convert to a tablet for other uses (reading, light web browsing, youtube, netflix, etc).  Finally, I wanted to be able to do some lightweight software engineering using Linux command line tools and Emacs/Vim.1)  Lightweight Notebook with large enough keyboardI'm a decent size (5'11"" 230lb) with stubby fingers and proportionate hands.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on, although I haven't done so for more than a 1-2 hours.  The screen is clear and bright and the system doesn't lag unless I have a large number of tabs open.2) Converted TabletAs a table it's slightly too long and there is no clear place to grip on the keyboard.  Gripping by the hinges or on either side of the trackpad work well.  However, the trackpad and the keyboard are not good places to grip as it feels like you may put too much pressure on these areas, or wear them out prematurely.  That being said, tablet mode is very usable, if a little awkward.  And the convenience of having the tablet and laptop in one device is a huge plus.3) Software EngineeringIt's all about Crouton here and being able to use the Linux CLI.  I'm somewhat old-school in that I prefer the command line and editors like Vim and Emacs to IDEs.  The ability to use Crouton to create Ubuntu chroots cannot be oversold as it creates a sandboxed development environment that is easy to maintain and control without intruding on the host system and potentially interfering with basic use.  With the Ubuntu chroot you get everything you would normally get with the Ubuntu distro.  I haven't needed X, and I prefer to develop on the vtys instead of a a crosh shell in the browser.  The reason is because the browser has a number of hotkeys that I prefer to be used by Emacs.

As someone who is a heavy user of Google services (drive, docs, sheets, etc.) in their daily work life, this pairs perfectly with my needs. In general, it has the look and feel of a premium laptop that is at home in any situation such as sitting down with a client. The backlit keyboard is a must-have; I would not purchase any laptop without this feature. The keyboard itself is probably the one physical weak point. It's fine, but I wish the keys had a bit more life and feel to them. The screen is bright and beautiful. The touchscreen works well. The overall device is slim and lightweight. I've not found the USB-C-only ports for connectivity to be a limitation. An inexpensive hub gives me HDMI-out, USB3 and even the ability to plug in an ethernet cable when needed. Battery life is outstanding. For day-to-day use, I drop the screen brightness to about 50% (more than adequate for most work activities) and I easily get eight hours, and sometimes in excess of nine. The device has plenty of power to crank along with lots of tabs and apps open. On the road I'll keep a live video stream open of a hockey game or something, while I continue to work in other windows.I bought this in anticipation of the addition of support for Android apps via the Google Play store. I have not been disappointed. From productivity to games, this upgrade is a gamechanger for Chromebook users. Not only does it dramatically increase the utility and functionality of Chromebooks, but it creates a wonderfully seamless experience when moving between a Chromebook and an Android phone.One of the things I had hoped was that I'd enjoy using this in ""tablet"" mode to read PDF resources. In practice, the device is heavier than is comfortable for this. That's not the fault of the device; just the form factor. I'm definitely looking forward to Chromebooks with removable keyboards in the future. But, it does work and is handy.This is my third chromebook and easily the best I've encountered. I think it is a great value at this price point.

Big_dataset_592,Big_dataset,"My first attempt at a review turned out to be more of a review of Chromebooks in general than of this specific model, so I am starting over and will summarize: I have an old desktop and an Android tablet, and while it can't replace the desktop, I usually reach for the C302 instead of my tablet, and I use remote desktop to operate the PC on the rare occasions when I need to. I will also say this: for non-Chromebook users, once you get used to the Chromebook way of doing things, you will be much happier and be surprised at the little niceties you never knew you missed.As a laptop, this is just the size I need. The screen is too high-res for me to use at its native resolution, but it seems ChromeOS is getting some better scaling functionality to handle different displays, and the ""fake"" lower-resolution mode (the display is used at its native resolution but everything is scaled) works well enough. The screen is of course very reflective which can be annoying, but perhaps a necessary tradeoff for a decent touch-screen experience. The glass does seem to be more of a fingerprint magnet than my tablet is, but I only really notice it when I'm using ""tablet"" mode.I like the aluminum chassis, though it doesn't really make it ""rugged"" and the finish also attracts fingerprints and smudges.  Asus's warranty does even cover accidental damage, though only if it affects operation of the device.The keyboard is often-praised, but I don't find it particularly spectacular. It's not as nice as my work laptop (Dell E7470) but I can accept it's good among chromebooks (and, importantly, Samsung: backlit). The keys take a little more force than I prefer. At first a couple keys (notably, the o key) did not always register. I'm not sure if the keyboard or I need a bit of break-in, or if it might be marginally defective (I think it's just me and I'm getting used to it, because it's happening less and less).I am not a touchpad user; normally I hate them. But (and whether this is due to chromeOS or this being an especially good touchpad), this one is actually pleasant to use once I learned the important gestures (especially scrolling). I got a bluetooth mouse but haven't been using it as much as I thought I would.The USB-C configuration is convenient (being able to charge or use the ports on either side). I thought just having the two ports would be a downside, but the reality is I rarely need to connect anything, and an inexpensive little adapter lets me use my old devices just fine. Oh, and this charges FAST. I do not get the rated battery life due to my heavy use of Android apps, but I do not get charger anxiety when taking it out and about. As I type this, not using any Android apps, it's estimating what would be a total of 10 hours on a full charge.The Android app experience is better than I expected, though it depends on the app (some can deal with window resizes, some can't) - to some extent, Android apps are indistinguishable from chrome apps. I can't complain about the performance of full-screen games. And to me, the apps are an important part of making ChromeOS useful to me, since I already have a library of apps I use on my phone and tablet.One of the things that drew me to the C302 was the convertible form-factor. I have a keyboard case for my tablet so I basically use the tablet in this way - sometimes flipped open, sometimes as a laptop. Even though the tablet+case is nearly double the thickness of the C302, I actually find the tablet mode of the C302 much less nice to use than the tablet, probably due to the harder metal edges of the C302. Also, I don't really mind exposing my inexpensive tablet keyboard to surfaces underneath, but I am a bit more concerned about the built-in one on the C302 (little bumpers do keep it off a flat surface but do not protect from debris). Some kind of clip-on cover for when you use tablet mode would be nice.Performance was another concern, but again, ChromeOS and even Android do not need as much power as Windows, and I've had nothing to complain about. Doesn't seem to me like the jump up to the m5 model is worth the extra money although I might change my mind later on as more Android apps get geared towards Chromebooks.Overall, if you decide a Chromebook (and one of this size) is right for you, I think this model is worth spending a little more for. The flexibility of tablet mode and the little bit of extra power will be of benefit as the Android app experience and ChromeOS itself mature.

Transfer speeds (LAN to NAS) were miserably slow (10-30Mbps), compared to my 2017 MacBook Pro 13 sitting next to it (500-600Mbps).Linux worked fairly well, and I was pretty pleased with it overall.

The default settings were acceptable, though.Unlike other ASUS laptops I've tried, this unit won the display roulette. It was perfect with no backlight bleed, no shimmery matte texture, no uneven backlight, no dead/stuck pixels. Just perfection. But it lost the coil whine roulette -- badly. I could literally hear it creaking away across the room 10ft away at night. I could hear it while listening to music with headphones on at my desk. There's absolutely no way I could put up with that. Research online shows that a large proportion of these units have coil whine. I'm not willing to play the roulette game with those kinds of odds, so it was time for a refund.

Big_dataset_607,Big_dataset,"I bought a Samsung Chromebook Pro in August, 2017. For me, the keyboard was unusable but I was intrigued with the concept of Chromebooks. Recently, I ordered an Asus C302ca through Amazon.mx which meant it was too expensive but that's life. As I consider the Samsung compared to the Asus I have to remember that the Asus has six months of development on my Samsung and the Chrome OS is evolving rapidly.The only plus the Samsung had over the Asus, for me, was the screen. Samsung nailed it with the screen. Unfortunately, their keyboard with some half-size keys and some missing keys wasn't usable. Consider hou often you use the backspace. I no longer have the Samsung so I'm going on memory. The Asus monitor is merely adequate. Even at the reduced resolution the Asus comes with, the font is so small I can barely read it.Using the Samsung was like getting a root canal. Using the Asus is, for me, a kick.

That's when I figured out, surprise, they're not putting the serial numbers on the back. Huh, why would they do that? If you don't have a serial number, you can't use your warranty. It's on the box but I'm used to Dell-who sends you packaging if you need to send something in, so I didn't keep a giant cardboard box sitting around. So, guess I'm screwed, because now after 6 months my TPM is no longer working and the whole computer is useless. I found a chrome page on how the TPM for these have a vulnerability. They've issued an update that I apparently must have approved of last night attempting to turn my volume down. Guess what happens if your computer dies while this update is installing? Goodbye to your computer. No reset works, an otherwise functional computer is completely useless and since they so conveniently left the serial number off, I can't use my warranty (which would be useless now anyway-since there is a small crack on the right corner of my laptop-exactly where someone else has noticed a mysterious crack occur) but I can't even send it in at all. So that's great. Don't let them scam you. I have no doubt this is what they are doing, systematically leaving of serial numbers of messed up laptops to save money. Thanks guys!

I've had as many as 21 tabs open, with 4 of them on YouTube, 6 or more with a Google Doc opened, and the rest on Craigslist webpages, including Facebook and news sites.Video playback was smooth and clean. The side firing speakers are acceptable for most things. However, when I'm writing, I'll need headphones. I left my Bluetooth headphones at work so I'll have to edit this review once I get to try that configuration.I also have USB-C to USB 3 him and some adapters coming so I can try some other things.Aesthetically, the unit looks very professional and serious.

The screen is really amazing and you can easily change it to 1080p with no issues (it's set lower out of the box).

The m3 processor (also available as m5 variant) is fast and easily handles anything I throw at it. It is a fanless processor so there are no vents or openings of any kind which makes this exceptionally quiet as well. The touchscreen is very responsive and works great in tablet mode.

I finally chose this one mainly because the design is so much better (it looks more like a MacBook, and the Samsung looks more like a sandwich... in other words it looks bulkier) and because the keyboard on the Asus is much superior to the Samsung (larger backspace key, backlit keys). It can handle multiple tabs with no slow down. A lot of reviews out there compare the screens between these two Chromebooks but honestly after using the ASUS Chromebook for 2 weeks now, the display is good, everything is clear and sharp. The hinge is nice and sturdy and does not creak (although I mostly use it as an actual laptop anyway not a tablet). The mousepad feels very comfortable to use. The Chromebook does feel a little bit heavy if I have to carry it too long but it’s not that big of a deal. Overall I’m really happy I chose this over the Samsung.

I've gone back to college and am studying to become a special education teacher. I needed a dependable device that was capable of letting me access my school's website and blackboard quickly and correctly, able to download easily, able to connect me with Google Docs for all of my assignments, etc., versatile, extremely lightweight for carrying from home to classes (requires much walking around campus), and with a lighted keyboard. This ASUS Chromebook has won me over!This Chromebook works like a dream. The power adapter can plug into either the left or right side of this Chromebook (really smart b/c my other laptop's port was damaged because I could only plug it into one side, but my power outlet was on the other side of my chair and the stress from it bending the other direction was too much), picture is amazing, fast speed (I do have excellent internet, though), I can open tons of tabs without any problems, the layout it easy to understand, access to apps, and it's soooo lightweight (can't believe I didn't get this sooner). I've had this around a week now and so far, so good! I use it daily. Also, I purchased a Logitech M535 wireless, bluetooth mouse, and it works great! I just pushed the bluetooth button on the back of it, clicked on settings in Chromebook, enabled bluetooth, the Chromebook instantly found the mouse, so I just clicked on the name of mouse it found (showed me the correct name it detected), and it instantly paired with my new mouse. Yay! Please note, though, that the built-in pad on this Chromebook works perfectly and I had no problem using that to click around. A mouse isn't necessary, but I have nerve and inflammation issues so for me, the mouse is less painful concerning movement. Just know that you can go either way and both work great. NOTE: I haven't had any issues with the touchscreen at all. Of course, you have to touch dead on for the Xs and this is a smaller screen, but for me, no problems anywhere on the screen.I used to use a ridiculously heavy D_ _ _  Inspirion, which I love because of the 17"" screen and capabilities, but I quickly found that carrying it anywhere caused my shoulders and back to hurt! It's that heavy. It was bulky to use in class, and I simply couldn't carry it around without pain. This semester, I said, ""That's it. I'm finding something else."" I didn't think I'd like a Chromebook without Windows. I was wrong. The Google Docs option does everything I need. I can even print from my older Canon MX printer. I used my larger laptop, signed into my Google account, went to Chrome settings, and added my printer. Then when I pulled my document up in Google Docs on my Chromebook, it recognized my older printer and voila! No problems.I purchased this from Emily's Store through Amazon and it arrived when expected, was in perfect condition, and they followed up with an email to ask me if I was happy with my purchase.

Not in this case.I received the first Chromebook as a Xmas gift. After one charge, the battery would not take charge. I gave ASUS the benefit of the doubt and sent the machine to them for repair. After about 2 weeks, it came back showing that several parts had been replaced. But it still didn't take charge. So I returned it to Amazon in exchange for a new machine.I plugged this one in with trepidation. Phew, it took power. But after three charge cycles the screen started vibrating vigorously from side-to-side.Looked up fixes on Google. No luck. So back to Amazon, and this will be my last try with ASUS.

Big_dataset_664,Big_dataset,"Skip to the fourth paragraph for the pros and cons of owning this laptop based on my own experience.This past summer, I began my search for a new laptop that fit just about every one of my rather finicky needs/wants. I read hundreds of reviews, used multiple compilation spec-based search engines, and bookmarked well over 4 dozen possible laptop upgrades as I scoured the internet for the perfect laptop. As I searched, I learned quite a lot about the minor details that can make or break a laptop, and tweaked my original list of ""must haves"" to include Chrome OS as an option as I learned more about chromebooks.I was hesitant at first to include Chrome OS in my searches - possibly due to the stigma that chromebooks are essentially useless, but I digress. However, after reading dozens of reviews and looking into the benchmarks, pros/cons, and price points of chromebooks, I quickly pushed that hesitation aside and began looking at these underappreciated laptops more and more each day. It was near the end of my months long search that I compiled a list of ""best suited laptops"" that included the Lenovo Yoga 4, Samsung Chromebook Pro, HP Spectre x365, and the ASUS C302.The Yoga 4 and Spectre x365 were quickly dropped from the list as they were far above my college student budget, and it was down to the Pro and C302. The Pro offered a strong community support, active stylus (a wonderful inclusion for me as I hate having so many notebooks), an aspect ratio that is more ""normal"", and more accessory options. The c302 offered a backlit keyboard (a must have for me as I do ALL of my school work at night), a sleek and rugged design/casing, and - at the time of purchase - playstore access (in beta channel). I went with the ASUS powerhouse and have loved it ever since.PROS:- The C302 is a machine that is amazingly fast - at least compared to my 3 year old Toshiba Satellite. Powering it on takes less than 20 seconds, and as soon as you log on there is no lag of any kind (aside from loading playstore apps, but even then it's still pretty speedy).- The physical design is absolutely amazing. The brushed metal casing is strong with little give if at all, and the hinge connections are wonderfully sturdy and smooth.- The screen is bright, and has keys in the top row for adjusting brightness as needed. These keys also function as brightness adjustments for the backlit keyboard as well, which is an unexpected and wonderful addition.- The file manager is very easy to navigate and the user interface as a whole, while confusing when using it for the first time ever, is very simple and elegant in appearance and usage.- The ability to download, and actually use, Google Playstore apps has been amazing (downloadable Netflix viewing may or may not be the main reason I like it so much), and I use these apps very frequently in my daily usage.- The keyboard is so satisfyingly beautiful and wonderful to type on. The keys offer a feedback that I have never experienced before: quiet - but still audible - clicks, a wonderful spring, and the spacing is just... perfect! This, along with the backlit keyboard, have made me entirely too picky about keyboards and their feel; no other keyboard I have used has been able to compare.- The battery life is better than any other device I've used or owned. Right now, the screen and keyboard brightness are all the way up, I have 6 tabs open, and the spotify app has been playing for the past 4 hours, and it has only drained about 20%. There have been days where I go to school for 9+ hours on a full charge, use this laptop for the majority of the time I am there, and still have 40% battery life remaining when I get home. I hardly ever feel the need to charge it, and it has surpassed any and all expectations I originally had.CONS:- The aspect ratio on the C302 is... Odd - to the say the least. I find myself becoming frustrated with reading articles, e-textbooks, and webpages all together due to having only a paragraph or two can fit on the screen when viewing them in landscape/clamshell mode. The very large bottom bezel of the screen is also something to laugh at in this situation, but it's hardly noticeable after getting used to the appearance of the screen itself.  -- Due to the aspect ratio, I find myself adjusting the resolution of the display rather regularly - which is actually really easy once you learn the many, extremely useful, keyboard shortcuts, and I have to adjust the screen zoom quite often as well.- This is mainly a personal frustration, but having 0 USB-A ports and only 2 USB-C ports is a little questionable. While USB-C is definitely the future of USB connections as a whole, I feel that having completely eradicating the classic and universally understood/used port wasn't the best idea. I have since purchased adapters for the ports that work very well and were very cheap - I just wish I didn't have to.- When the laptop is plugged in and reaches a full charge, there's barely audible whirring/whistling noise that comes from the left side of the base. This isn't necessarily causing any problems, and it seems to be a common ""complaint"" with this laptop, but I wanted to mention it in case anyone who experiences this may fear there is something wrong.- Very rarely, but still often enough to mention, the browser glitches and becomes unresponsive. This is always due to having more 5+ tabs open, and with the m3 processor, it just becomes slightly over powered. The easiest solution to this is just closing a tab or two and you're back to normal usually.- Occasionally, I have experienced some touch pad problems where I could be using it just fine one minute, and it stops working properly, or at all, the next. It's extremely sensitive, and I've found that my hands may just be slightly too dry, or my shirt or another object was resting on the touchpad and interfering with its ability to follow my finger.- Lastly, the touchscreen is NOT good for anything other than using it to pinch zoom, tap-click, or tap-drag. It isn't very accurate, and I have tried using a basic sketch application with a disc stylus to see if I could get better results, but it simply isn't made for motions or anything that requires accuracy. Also, it requires a surprising amount of pressure for it to sense your fingers and react accordingly.

I've enabled Android apps on it, and with the latest Chrome OS release, many of them work really well and their windows can be resized to suit your taste.  No more having to choose between a full screen window or a phone size window.  Since the Chromebook has 64GB of storage, I went ahead and gave 20GB to a Fedora install using chrx, and the Chromebook part still has 30GB available after installing a ton of Android apps.

Big_dataset_702,Big_dataset,"I am fully invested in the Chrome platform, and this is my third Chromebook - replacing a very capable Acer C720 with i3 processor that unfortunately can no longer hold a battery charge. I did quite a bit of research, and it came down to either a Samsung Pro, or the ASUS C302 (the Google Pixel being highly desirable, but outside my budget). I was able to try the Samsung at Best Buy, but was unable to try the ASUS anywhere. I obviously wasn't able to put the Samsung through its paces properly in-store, but I was able to get a good idea of its features, and of course the design and finish.Although the Samsung's 3:2 screen is excellent (and would not have been a deal-breaker), I prefer a 16:9 screen which this ASUS has - particularly as I am unlikely to ever use a Chromebook as a tablet. The major downside to the Samsung from a feature perspective is its lack of a backlit keyboard. I do a lot of work late at night, and this feature has become very desirable.After watching a comprehensive online video review comparing the Samsung Pro and the ASUS C302, I decided to blind-buy the ASUS based on the screen and backlit keyboard. After a week of use, I can safely say it is the most impressive Chromebook I have used to-date. The m3 processor is fast and fluid. The screen is fantastic. And the backlit keyboard has a very good feel, and great key ""travel.""The only downside to the ASUS is that there are three minor blemishes on the beveled edge of the aluminium chassis on the left-hand side of the screen. They don't impact the screen in any way, but they are noticeable. Before buying my last Acer Chromebook a couple of years ago, I ordered and returned two ASUS C200 machines that both had quality control issues (one had debris behind the screen, the other a wonky touchpad). So, all three ASUS Chromebooks I have purchased have had some kind of issue - which does raise questions about ASUS's quality control processes.I have decided to keep this exact machine rather than return to Amazon for exchange, as everything else about it is fantastic, and seems to be working flawlessly. There is also a concern that an exchange machine might have a blemish-free case, but could then have another, more fundamental issue.Despite the minor case marks, I can heartily recommend this Chromebook based on features, design, and operation. However...ASUS: If you are reading, this would have been a five-star review had your QC been better.

Big_dataset_706,Big_dataset,"I’m a professional IT guy.  So when I buy something for myself, I know what I’m looking for and I do my homework. This is easily the best overall Chromebook out there right now (under $500).  There’s nothing I don’t like about this device, so in order of importance, here’s what I love about it.Backlit KeyboardFirst off, WOW - I’d pay an extra $200 (the difference between this Chromebook and the average entry-level Chromebook) just for this lighted keyboard.  The nerd press may talk about key travel and deflection, but I’m just talking about visibility.  I’m typing this review in a dark room, and it reminds me how much I LOVE this backlit keyboard.  The keys are clearly lit, and there’s the perfect amount of luminosity between them to provide good contrast and relief for the keys and the keyboard.  This could not be better executed.  Like I said, I’d pay an additional $200 just for the keyboard.Speed - CPU (Intel Core m3)I love how quick this thing is. I have an 8th Gen Core i5 16GB laptop at work, so I’ve become conditioned to instantaneous response.  This thing isn’t that fast, but for loading web pages, it’s pretty close.  The older Chromebooks were ok, especially for the price - you got what you paid for.  But with this generation, you get more than you pay for!Screen Brightness and ClarityGreat!  The brightness and clarity are awesome.  Don’t be worried about nits and lumens and all those other measurements.  The nerd press use them in their evaluations because they have to, but in the real world, the rest of us only worry about what looks great and what doesn’t, and this screen does.Build Quality and AppearanceThis is quality hardware, and it shows.  More than once I’ve had fellow nerds admire it, and for those of you who don’t know tech, that’s the highest compliment you can pay a device.  One nerd even said he thought it was a new MacBook.TouchscreenIt’s great.  I don’t really use the Chromebook as a tablet, but I use the touchscreen much more than I thought I would - as another input device, like an adjunct mouse or touchpad.  It’s complementary, not revolutionary, which is much more intuitive and useful.Hinges and 360° FoldabilityAgain, this is where the build quality really shines.  This thing folds and sticks in any position like a Swiss Army knife.  There’s no flex in the movement, just perfect uniformity of motion along a single axis.Surface - resists fingerprints, smudgesBeing a nerd - and proudly OCD - I don’t do dirt.  I value cleanliness, and even more, the appearance of cleanliness.  I don’t hate dirt because it’s dirty, I hate it because it’s a distraction.  The matte silver finish of this device feels great and looks great.  Very sterile.MicroSD card slotA big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic. Older Chromebooks had SD card slots that left the card jutting out.  Not this one. The MicroSD slot leaves an inserted card perfectly flush. I dig that because then the card is visually integrated, not an obvious add-on.

Big_dataset_709,Big_dataset,"This is nothing more than an okay laptop to get you through basic work activities.Pros: Pretty quick when a lot of tabs are open. You can charge the device on either side of the computer. It folds back into a tablet for easy reading. You can switch between tabs by using four fingers on the trackpad for easy navigating. The laptop is pretty lightweight.Cons: The speakers make a loud muffled white noise while playing music on occasion. There is NO HDMI hookup so if you want to print, your printer better have Bluetooth capabilities. Playing music from Spotify sometimes takes long pauses so I have to refresh the page often and adding songs to my playlist often takes awhile. My online class sometimes has issues loading. I also have issues with websites that require latest Adobe Flash Player for some reason.I would probably return this laptop if it wasn't so important for my classes. Thanks for trying, Asus.

On top of that the whole process took 2 weeks.  But here's the kicker, not even 2 months later, the same thing happens.

Speaker's are OK but not amazing, I do like that they are mounted on the sides so they work well in laptop or tablet mode equally well.The battery could be better however, I get about 4-5 hours of heavy spreadsheet/web usage. The included charger charges it very quickly though.Definitely recommend this chromebook, it's a beautiful machine. My partner has decided to buy the exact model after using mine :)

Big_dataset_766,Big_dataset,"Had this for two days. Initial impressions are all positive (at least from a hardware standpoint). I'm a bit less enthused about ChromeOS, but it seems to be (barely) capable of meeting my needs. I'm hoping it will improve in the areas I find it lacking, but I feel like I can make do for the time being.The hardware is solid. I have three small quibbles, but they're nitpicks rather than issues.1. The  trackpad, which works quite well, tends to feel a bit resistant to finger movement.2. Coming off a Dell XPS 9350 the bezels around the screen feel monstrous3. The keyboard is missing a few keys I'm very used to (delete, pg up, pg down, end, home)Things I love1. The flip screen. I've never had a 2 in 1 and after playing with the screen to watch some Youtube videos I'm quite impressed. It's so fun!2. The keyboard is one of the best I've used on an ultrabook (vs Macbook 12 and Dell XPS 9350).3. It's quite fast and capable for all the apps I've tried so far. Haven't noticed a touch of lag anywhere.4. It's very light. Not quite as light as the MB12 (which felt almost weightless, even after carrying around for 8 hours), but noticeably lighter than the Dell.ChromeOSIt's better than I thought it would be, but it's got a long way to go before I could recommend it to anyone. Teamviewer works, which is required for my job as I need to do occasional tech support remotely. Evernote is terrible on ChromeOS, worse even than the MacOS version. Everything else I've tried so far works as expected.The lone real issue I've found is storage access. It's great this laptop comes with a MicroSD slot for additional storage, but none of the apps I've tried to so far can access it, let alone index any files on it. To play music or videos from the MSD, you have to open file manager and execute the file, which opens whatever app (VLC in my case) that is associated with that file type. It works, but this is the ONE thing I'd really like to see ChromeOS fix in the near future.For now I intend to keep this laptop and play with it more. For the price (already cheap at $500 and I got it on a Warehouse Deal for $350) it's a stellar piece of technology. I just hope my initial impressions only improve. I'll probably update in a few weeks.

Here's why:The 3.5mm Stereo mini plug (the one we all use for headphones) outputs at a volume so low as to render the plug useless.  Of course this was discovered on a 9 hour flight to Europe, rendering all my media useless and inaccessible.  After getting home I checked Amazon online reviews for this issue and learned this is a feature - not a bug.  Many other people in this forum complained of this problem; I think there are some hardware add-on fixes - or Acer could just FIX IT... I'm not buying yet another piece of junk to stick onto a machine that has a design flaw this big.Beyond that, less than a week into the ownership trial, the power supply failed.  Dead.  Amazon shipped a replacement (looked to be OEM, but it worked).  But still - not good having a critical component fail less than 2 weeks into the life of the machine.Other issues:  machine shipped with an old version of Chrome OS, which did NOT support the Android Play Store; it took 2 or 3 major OS updates until when I bought was actually working.  There was no warning this was the case, which made this was a painful ""out of the box"" process.The idea here is to break the 2-year windows machine buy cycle - Chromebooks are now properly built to provide a zippy, pleasant experience with the promise of no OS slowdown to the infernal registry. But basic stuff needs to be properly engineered and designed, and this machine had two HUGE problems right out of the gate.

Sure, I get the odd android app glitches every now and then and certain apps won't scale properly with this, mainly impart to its traditional aspect ratio. I find the display sharp and touch responsive to be quite excellent.The battery life, good not amazing as I am able to get through most day with moderate usage. The typing experience is something I thoroughly enjoyed, this is one of the best keyboard I have used on any portable device. Overall, would recommend this.On a side note, there is a slight defect on my chromebook as there is some creaking and loose feeling when pressing on the bottom left side of my screen, this can be especially annoying in tablet mode.

Yay Amazon customer service they replaced it immediately for me no questions asked...Nicley done Amazon.The second one arrived, I had it from End of May June,  to September started to notice the A key was a bit unresponsive at times.The tail end of October Noticed the A key was actually off-kilter so I pushed it down well it pops off.  I call Asus get some guy I can barely understand from who knows where.  I ask him  What I need to do he verified my one-year manufacturer warranty creates the RMA. Was told to send it in they gave me an RMA I boxed it up under protest because I am now out of my chrome book. Why are there not places in Colorado that can fix this manufacture certified?  I shipped it, used the tracking number,  I Verify it was received took them 3 days to even show they had it after I confirmed it was received FedEx. Days go buy,  I hear nothing,  then  I get an E-mail saying I need to verify my Warranty, the one they Already verified. I'm a bit irritated at this point, so I send my purchase PDF from Amazon upload that to their website also stupid to use days go by again,  Then I get an email telling me the A key is broken and this is considered customer damage. I'm like are you serious, Uh  I know the A key is broken That is why I sent it in. Oh yeah, we need payment of 130 bucks, bear in mind, I have already laid out 500  for this unit.

Big_dataset_796,Big_dataset,"Pros: light-sensor back-lit keyboard, great battery, fast startup, average-student friendlyCons: no caps lock key (still haven't found it, help!), no HDMI or USB 3.0, lacks traditional laptop functionalityMy parameters for a new laptop included: fast, lightweight, back-lit keyboard, long battery life, and dirt cheap.I purchased this laptop on Cyber Monday and received it one week ago, diving deep into the Chromebook unknown.Holy Moly. I love this Chromebook. If you work off of GoogleDrive (or are willing to make the transition) let me tell you, this was worth it. Even then, you can download Microsoft Office apps from the Playstore. I purchased this machine on Cyber Monday for $375 ($75 off the listing price at the time of this review) and I think at that price point, it's well worth it. The touch screen is really accurate, and the 360 flip feature is really easy - I can switch to tablet mode anytime, although I use this much more often as a laptop.The startup time is ridiculously fast, and just opening the laptop will turn it on and get you going on Chrome within 10 seconds - I've had as many as 12 tabs open, and it still ran smoothly. The back-lit keyboard I'm guessing uses a light sensor: I tested in different settings, and it turns off when there is strong overhead lighting. Using it with one lamp lit in the back will prompt it to turn on. I do not know if there is a keyboard button for this.The battery life is a huge selling point in my opinion: even after multiple shut-downs/start-ups throughout the day, I get about 10 hours total run-time, and charging only takes about an hour.My only issue with this laptop is its lack of a USB 2.0/3.0 connection as well as an HDMI port. However, I knew that the laptop lacked both when I purchased it... the only hassle is having to buy an adapter. I did find some here on amazon for as cheap as $5.99. Not a huge sacrifice.All in all, this is a great laptop for the casual user, especially at this price point. It lacks some functionality that you may get with a traditional PC, like gaming or applications outside of the playstore, but for a college student who wanted high battery power + a lighter load in my backpack (more room for books!) this is definitely the way to go.The pros definitely outweigh the cons, earning this Chromebook 5 stars.

My primary goal is to find a Chromebook laptop with minimum 1080P display and at least 4GB of RAM alone with lightest weight possible for mobility. Therefore I ended up getting this Core m3 version.My secondary goal is to have a touch-capability Chromebook which would allow me to enjoy Play Store with the ability of installing Android app. Up till now (December of 2017), there's only a few of devices that support this ""full"" function (with stable build OS) and I personally think ASUS has done it right to gain this support as their marketing features besides the physical design of the product.I must say 12.5"" screen isn't my best choice for a laptop. Yet, compare with other flip-style of Chromebooks, the screen is sufficient for me to do my code. The biggest reason for me to pick this laptop over others is the light-weight design and its overall spec. Only drawback is the price doesn't look too pretty for most of Chromebook users. If ASUS has a stripped down version with Celeron-graded CPU, it would be a easy holiday gift!Overall I like its slim design and feather light-weight alone with well equipped spec that can meet my daily work environment.

When it has served me well, this Asus Chromebook flip C302CA is amazing. Downloading Android apps was easy after doing a standard OS update, and really adds to the Chrome experience. Touchscreen is phenomenal and although awkward to hold when in full tablet mode, a neat feature to have. Speakers are nice and loud. Be prepared to commit to USB-C as you get two of these ports and nothing else. So even using an hdmi cable will require an adapter, as will an adapter be required for plugging in a standard USB flash drive.

On the plus side, Samsung Pro has a much better screen, and it feels more comfortable using it as a tablet since it's lighter. I tried the unit at Best Buy and to be honest, it felt a bit flimsy as a laptop. The keyboard is awkward to the touch and the internals only has 32GB of hard drive. The extra space makes a huge difference when you download games/apps from the Play store. I also compared the audio on both units and the Asus wins, but not by much. The sound isn't great on both devices but they'll suffice; at least the Asus speakers are side-firing and not coming from the bottom like the Pro. All and all, I made the right decision to go with Asus. It feels and performs mighty solid as a laptop.

Big_dataset_838,Big_dataset,"I’ll compare this ASUS Chromebook Flip with 12.5″ touchscreen (and Intel m3 processor) to the smaller and more portable ASUS Chromebook Flip C101PA-DB02 with 10.0″ touchscreen in just a moment, but first let’s look at its specs.This Chromebook weighs just under 2.7 pounds and has dimensions of about 12″ x 8.25″ x .6″ thick. The chassis is aluminum (feels sturdy!), and the computer has a 12.5″ 1920×1080 touchscreen.What I like about this Chromebook is that the touchscreen’s hinge allows you to rotate the screen 360 degrees — you can use it of course as a normal laptop, but you can also stand it up like a tent in case, for example, you want to make a presentation or share a video with a group of people, and you can rotate the backlit keyboard completely under the screen to use the Chromebook as a tablet.The Chromebook’s battery lasts about 10 hours of mixed use, and it comes with a USB-C charging brick and cable. One benefit is that this model comes with a USB-C port on each side, so that you can charge on either side. One gripe is that the prongs for the charging brick do not swivel into the brick body like more travel-friendly chargers.This model comes with a peppy Intel Core m3 processor, 64GB of storage, and 4GB of RAM. The keyboard and touch interface seemed responsive and the apps I used were very responsive, so these technical specifications seem more than adequate for many office or home use cases, such as word processing, email, browsing, and watching videos. I used it to connect to my work’s virtual desktop infrastructure (Citrix VDI) and this was a great use-case due to the good keyboard and screen. Other technical specs include 802.11ac+Bluetooth 4.0 (Dual band), Webcam, 1 Micro SD slot (took my 64GB card I use in my GoPro just fine), 2 USB-C ports, and 1 headphone out and audio in combo jack.Being a Chromebook, it runs Chrome OS and you have access to apps on the Google Play Store. Since I already had another Chromebook, all my apps were automatically downloaded, my toolbar was setup correctly, and my Chrome browser homepage was even configured correctly, though I had already agreed to backup my apps to Google.Setup was easy:1. Enter your WiFi connection information2. Enter your Google login/password3. Uncheck (or leave checked) the checkbox to opt out of automated error messages sent to google (defaults checked)And then the OS updated itself. Once the first download finished, I restarted it, then there was another round of OS updates, then there was a second restart.This all sounds perfectly fine, but before you make your decision, you might want to compare it to the smaller ASUS Chromebook Flip C101PA-DB02 with 10.1-Inch Touchscreen. While the smaller version is obviously more portable, with the larger one you get a slightly more spacious and backlit keyboard as well as a larger and higher resolution (full HD!) touchscreen. Check the included pics in this review for direct physical comparisons.All in all, I found this to be a workhorse Chromebook -- with backlit keys!Thanks for reading and I hope you found this review helpful.

Big_dataset_844,Big_dataset,"The Asus C302 is the best Chromebook you can buy. I've used it daily for 3 months to stream video, work with google docs AND emulate games from the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64 and the Sega Genesis. The ability to use it as a regular laptop then flip it into a tablet or put it in tent mode to watch video without seeing the keyboard is great. The touch screen is super responsive and the keyboard is excellent. Overall the machine very much reminds me of my Macbook Pro and even has a backlit keyboard for a fraction of the cost. If you are into gaming, Chrome OS lets you add the google play store and get access to games and apps available on Android OS. It runs most of those apps and games beautifully and when combined with a ""Logitech Gamepad F310"" you can play the games with a game controller!  I've tried multiple controllers in the past without any success as Chromebooks have issues with the drivers but the Logitech gamepad works beautifully on this ASUS C302.  The controller even works on those emulator games so that you can play Super Mario World, etc. with an actual game controller and feel like a kid again. When I bought this chromebook I also got the Samsung Chromebook Pro to try head to head based on reviews and the ASUS was clearly the knock out winner for me. The screen is not as bright as the Samsung but the keyboard is far superior as is the build quality.  After 2 weeks with the Samsung Chromebook Pro I had to return it because the screws in the case were coming loose just with light use of the machine and I could hear the casing creaking when I'd pick it up.

It feels amazing and the travel is perfect. The buttons are a bit mushy, as I am used to typing on a mechanical keyboard, but it isn't a big deal to me personally.This BIGGEST weak point and my only major complaint is that the speakers on it just suck. They are loud enough to fill a small, quiet room, but that is about it. Luckily I have a Bluetooth speaker, and I just use that if I want to watch videos or anything. When I am using it in school, I always use headphones so it isn't a big deal there. But if I am just laying in bed and watching Netflix and I have a fan on, I have to use headphones or my external speaker. The screen doesn't get super bright either, so it may be a hassle outdoors; but that doesn't bother me personally, but it may be a con to some.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase, and I am in love with the simplicity of the Google ecosystem. This is a perfect choice if you already have a desktop at home and just need a travel computer.

It's such a nice computing experience it terms of the quality of everything that I decided I wanted to find a device with similar capabilities and materials but not spend as much just in case Google decides to screw me over again.  Finally, the Samsung Chromebook pro came out which I was convinced would fit the bill but unfortunately the typing experience ruined the entire package so back to the store it went.  Then the ASUS flip C302 came into my life:*Battery* - Battery life is great.  Depending on my use i can get 6-9 hours of use between charges.  Speaking of charges, it's so nice to be able to use USB C.  Our phones are USB C so one cable does everything for me.*Keyboard* - The keyboard is alright.  It's miles better than the Samsung Chromebook plus or pro, but still miles behind the 1st gen Chromebook pixel that I'm leaving.  The backlight works great and I had no problems using it in the dark.*Track pad* - The trackpad is well done.  It's a nice smooth surface so no tension when gliding across it.  Multi-touch input works great.  I have no complaints in this department.  It's not quite as nice as a MacBook pro but given the price difference, it's not far away.*Android Apps* - Android apps have a long way to go before they work like first class citizens on Chrome OS.  They work, technically they work, but it's hit or miss in terms of does an app properly support tablet mode or is it a phone app stretched across the screen.  If it renders in tablet mode, is it cutting off some of the app (sometime bottoms of apps are cutoff)?  80% of the apps it's a poor experience.  20% of the apps it's a decent experience.  This will get better with time.I'll point out that Google doesn't allow any Android application to be device administrator on a Chromebook so any MDM/MAM apps (intune, airwatch, mobileiron, MaaS360m etc) that requires device admin privileged will not work.*Build Quality* - I'm really pleased with the overall quality.  The frame/body is awesome and metal.  There is no wiggle or wobble or creaks or groans or nothing.  It's solid.Overall, I’m happy with this purchase and have no issues keeping it as my daily driver.

But I cannot live with 10% volume from the headphone jack, and will be compelled to return the device if the Samsung Chromebook Plus tests better. Does anyone have an opinion on whether or not this volume issue may have been deliberately coded into the software to ""protect"" hearing loss caused by ""excess"" volume. I would like a quick fix but have not found one that would allow me to consider keeping this beautiful Asus Chromebook.UPDATE - My Samsung Plus arrived today and my first comparison was sound volume through headphone jack outputs. Short version - CLEAR WINNER Samsung Plus. I also decided that despite the advantages of the Asus, I cannot live with the sharp edges and middling volume. Therefore my thinking today, I will be keeping the Samsung and returning the Asus, which I believe to be defective, based on my home testing.

Big_dataset_873,Big_dataset,"This chromebook is awesome. I avoided tablets for the longest time because I prefer functional devices and dont like software keyboards, or even using my phone much. I found no use for it for my needs.But I needed a thin laptop for travel as I wanted to travel light. I bought a lot of things to fit this purpose.I have a lot of Asus products and am happy with their service and quality of product, and this is no exception.The tablet here works well. I mostly use it for phone gaming right now during work, because I dont need apps for too much, but as I travel, which I havent done yet, i would be more likely to use the tablet in places without a proper desk to use it in laptop form.The touchscreen works well, the apps generally work, the performance is good. Screen resolution is good. Not sure what else to say about that feature.As for the laptop, the keyboard has full size keys, which I love. The mousepad is functional but really doesnt get in the way, unlike on my larger laptop. The keyboard is missing some useful keys, like the delete key I believe, but its ok. They have a big backspace, and with the laptop being so thin and only 13"" I expect some sacrifice and it isnt a big problem. I expect to buy a small but full key travel keyboard when I travel more anyway, just like I use an external wireless mouse.The laptop folds and transitions between laptop and tablet without issue.The plugs are good and bad. Only bad because no USB 3.0, but I bought some 3.1-3.0 adapters and since it has 2 USB 3.1 outlets, I can use them as needed, 1 for keyboard, and 1 for mouse or 1 for mouse, 1 for external hard drive, etc.. Of course, you can buy a USB 3.1 extension dongle. They have a headphone jack, micro SD slot, decent speakers on the side, so it will provide stereo sound, and 2 3.1 USB slots. These are the only features.The laptop does have storage for downloading things and can be saved to the SD slot of course.But remember, this is a chromebook. It is essentially just a chrome browser as the OS. You cant run any programs on it that dont run on chrome or compatible browsers, and any google store apps that are made for the phone only really run in tablet mode. They only seem to run in laptop mode in a small box.I use it for work using the google docs platform, it plays any videos. Basically, it is great for work and media as long as you dont need other proprietary programs to do your work.

A new update would occur, and all of a sudden, some drivers would stop functioning, preventing me from carrying out tasks that I would do on a weekly basis.I finally decided to switch to a more lightweight operating system, and bought the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA. My wife previously used the C100PA, and loved it.This chromebook is great system that is lightweight, has excellent battery life, and offers a fantastic keyboard. I used to have a Thinkpad T470, which is on another level in terms of keyboard excellence, but the typing experience on this C302 is actually a pleasant surprise. I have not fiddled around much with the touchscreen yet, but it seems very responsive. I have yet to experience any slowdowns on this machine. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase.

Bluetooth headphones/speakers do the trick just fine, but sometimes, I'd like to watch a movie or show a youtube video to a friend and it's embarrassing to say ""Yep, that's as loud as the speakers go."" 2) After having access to android apps, I realize that I'm not even using them with my touch screen. Maybe I need to watch videos on how this is more useful than my phone. I think having android app access on my laptop is a step in the right direction, but I'm not fully using them. 3) I feel like I could have paid half as much for another model and done just fine with the computer specs.

No need to carry a tablet for Android games the flip does that. The Chromebook Pixel 2 LS can do it to but drains the battery and my power pack I carry. Using the flip is a lot easier on my battery pack because I use it to keep my phone powered as well as it is my hot spot for the internet. Playing my game Megapolis on the Pixel LS  drained the power pack and my Pixel 2 LS. Using it with the Flip doesn't. There is no lag in performance in my use. The flip is the device I carry now. I use the Pixel 2 LS only at home now. The only thing I didn't like is the screen isn't bright enough and the speakers aren't louder. Other than that it's perfect for my needs.

So i can't fill out a form- I can't even complete the form for my 3 yr warranty i bought b/c there is no serial number. The Asus tech guy said it should be on the box- that i threw away- or on my Amazon invoice. It is not listed on the invoice. THe sticker on the back of the computer is just blackish-grey . If there were any numbers written on it they have since worm off in the past 6 months. ALso- I have to jiggle it sometimes to get the power cord connected. You think it is charging but really it is not. I waited a long time for this computer and to me $500 is a lot of money. If you buy this computer i suggest you SAVE THE BOX b/c that is the only way you will have a serial number. I guess i will see if a storecan put in a new headphone jack at my own expense. Otherwise ASUS will fix it but b/c of no serial number it will take a long time. At least a month  - after i send it back to them.UPDATE: OK the chormoe help online - a team of volunters found a way to find the buiilt in serial number- something the ASUS people wais was impossible. SO now i have the serial number.THe problem dinvolves the headphone jack. I figured out that IF i TURN OFF blluetooth the headphone jack magically works.  SO- i was just going to accept that unless i buy a windeows i can never have bluetoothe. I have had chromebooks for 10 yr's and none of them coneected to bluetooth correctly. I was hoping this was diff with the $500 price tag. Now my NEW issues is : the headphone jack is barley working even with the bluetooth turned off. I can't plaug in a speaker b/c the built in speakers are louder thatn the speaker itself- unreal! I at first, was just going to keep the chromebook and plug and plug in the speaker. ( without bluetooth turned on ofcouse). BUT now - anthing you plug into the headphone jack barely works. I can't head through the headphones. compuathhth. ALso- i am still minfull of making sure the computer is actually charging- b/c you have to have the charger plugged in just right or it will not charge. Alas, I will have to have it fixed. I am not sure if can get it fixed locally and be reimbursed or if I am required to send it away. I will call ASUS again. Once again- i d not recommend this computer. It has only been 6 months of use. ALso- the other day- it was really really weird. It would not charge at all!.  I finally somehow got it to charge. I thought ""this is the end- just like my other acer  that was only 2 yr's and would not charge for the last 1.5 yr's without jiggling. ...until it finally stopped. I consider the life of a chromebook to be 2 yr's.I don't know why i purhased a 3 yr warranty.  Maybe all the ports are are  bad- not just the headphone. If you have a recommendation for a ccomputer that is lightweight is a backlit- please let me know.

I compared it to the Samsung models. I chose the Asus because I wanted the 64 GB hard drive instead of 32. The stylus for the Samsung was not that much of an incentive for me. I also prefer the aspect ratio on the Asus. Others may differ; to each their own. As for the Asus, it is a wonderful laptop. I have a MacBook Pro I bought in January 2015, and this Asus reminds me so much of it. The keyboard on the Asus is fantastic. I have had no issues with the track pad; it works fine. Some who have bought this Chromebook noticed a coil whine. Not for me. The first thing I did out of the box was update Chrome OS. When I did so I was asked if I wanted access to the Google Play store. It is no longer in beta form for this Chromebook. I added a few apps. Most work fine, but a few do not resize and are small on the screen. Using it in tablet or tent mode works fine. I have not fully tested  battery life but it seems to last about as long as advertised.Two minor things I noticed that would be negatives. One, the display is gorgeous; watching video is a treat. However, there is screen glare, even in a normally lit room, not just a brightly lit room. The screen glare is most apparent watching video, and not while reading text. Secondly, the sound quality is generally good and loud enough, but have found on Hulu the sound is not as loud sometimes, both on the website and the app. When that is the case, wearing headphones solves the problem.

Believe me when I say this as I came from a late 2016 MacBook Pro and this really is great. The keyboard has excellent travel and just feels right, much better than the current MacBook Pro keyboards. I spend most of my day casting music to my TV and browsing the web and this does those things with flying colors. The support of the Play Store in Beta is also a nice addition like icing on a cake. I highly recommend this product to any one whose needs are simple and mostly web based. If you need actual programs on this the Play Store can help, and there's a developer mode that you can get a linux distro on this. I didn't do it, but I just might in the future for fun. I love Linux, but currently Chrome OS is good enough for my needs. Hope this helped you make a decision.

Prior to this, I was using a Samsung XE303C12. It served my needs of web browsing and word processing for a number of years, but its battery life had dwindled and neither the screen nor the processor can match this ASUS. It boots in seconds, and I get ~10 hours out of the battery. I don't use the touch screen much if at all, but the ability to convert to a tablet mode is handy if needed. I don't typically use my chromebooks as a media device very often, so I can't comment on the speakers since I haven't really tested them yet. My only gripe is that I wish there was a way to default the screen brightness as well as default the keyboard backlight to off.

However, when I play a video it only plays through the Chromebook speakers. Therefore, I spend another five minutes in an attempt to pair the devices, even though it says they are already paired. It is infuriating how bad this feature is, and would keep me from ever owning another ASUS.

Big_dataset_936,Big_dataset,"I really like this Chromebook. It's fast, lightweight. It can run Android apps (on the beta channel). The shell is thin and seems to be durable. Unfortunately, mine is defective. After less than a day of use, I noticed a small, but noticeable bulge in the trackpad. When I pushed down the bulge, it went away. Afterwards, the trackpad no longer clicked. Then it began misregistering my touches. It would work for a short time, then stop working. I reached out to support. They want me to send it back for RMA. It will be gone for 7-10 days. I'm not thrilled about this.UPDATE: Amazon was nice enough to take back the broken one. I'll ship this one back once the new one comes. I reset the stars for now. A couple of quick thoughts:1. Overall, this thing is really solid (except for my trackpad). There is little to no flex in it. I would put the structure on par or better than my work Macbook Air. I'm really hoping this trackpad issue was a fluke.2. Asus and Google have made some really nice touches to the way the hardware and software interact. If you flip the thing into tablet mode, you get a new set of controls for things like window switching and screen rotation. Reading big documents (or comics) in portrait mode is really nice. It's definitely a little heavy on your arms for long reading sessions unless you prop it up on your knees.3. It's plenty snappy. I haven't seen anything really slow it down yet. Tabs and Android apps are very responsive.Broken trackpad aside, this is a great little machine. In a lot of ways, I think it will be my primary home computer.

It is sleek and decent eye candy. It also feels a bit heavier than the 2.65 pounds listed.MISLED and DISAPPOINTED! This device IS NOT Google Play Store ready! The Chrome OS version was set at 53 and after updating a couple of times to the current stable version of 59, the App Store still isn't onboard. In total, it took 4 updates to access the Google Play Store--completely unacceptable! To add to the madness, my experience running the beta channel has been troublesome. Several of my Chrome extensions perform poorly and have to be disabled altogether which degrades my work production experience.TOUCH SCREEN performance was inconsistent in that it was nonresponsive a good bit of the time requiring second and third retries or applying considerable pressure to complete an action such as clicking a button or exiting a screen. Again, very disappointing. I will give this feature a day or two to see if my normal touch style will adapt.SCREEN BRIGHTNESS. I don't think that I was adequately prepared for how dark the screen is at its highest brightness in comparison to other devices. In addition, I find the crispness of app icons and images to be less than that of the Samsung Plus and Pro. It is adequate but noticeably different in my opinion.MODES. After using the tablet and tent modes, the cursor arrow (and hand) was upside once the device returned to standard laptop mode. Bizarre! To fix this, I returned it to tablet mode and then back to laptop mode and it reverted fine.More than anything, I wanted this device to outperform a prominent similarly featured device. Up until this point, ASUS Chromebooks have been my favorite. Although I am a Samsung Note smartphone owner, I've purchased 2 ASUS Chromebooks in the last 2 years. I chose this device because of its power, app store, and a few other features trading off the option for an onboard stylus and improved screen resolution.I’ve watched many video comparison reviews and read even more outlining the pros and cons of this device and its closest competitors. It was a difficult choice. Considering the problems I've experienced so far with this Chromebook and the price point, there is no longer a comparison. I will be returning.

Big_dataset_950,Big_dataset,"I just received this chromebook about 3 days ago, and so far I love it.  The build quality is amazing.  I am coming from the Acer Chromebook R11 with its 720p screen and all plastic build, and the Asus Flip blows it out the water.  It has an excellent screen, great keyboard and trackpad(keyboard is backlit), and wonderful performance.  I thought my Acer had very good performance, but the Flip is significantly better.  The core m3 processor handles everything really well.  Since I've only had about 3 days, I can't give you a good measure on battery life, but I seem to be somewhere in the 6-7 hour range, with my brightness and backlit keyboard both set to around 80%.  This is only slightly better than my old Acer.  Once again, I keep my screen much brighter than most people probably do.  Standby time is very good as well.  As far as the android apps go, I am running Chrome version 60 which has the apps on the Stable Channel.  Most of the apps I have tried seem to work well, except for Amazon Prime Video.  It didn't work at all on my Acer R11, and it only works sometimes on the Asus Flip.  I know this app was just released last week on the Google play store, and I can't help but wonder if Chrome OS was just not optimized for it.  I downloaded the same app on my Nexus 5X, and I had no issues with it.  Hopefully that will get ironed out, because I love my Amazon Prime Video.  Haven't tried running any games on it other than my Sonic game, which was perfect.  Didn't run any octane scores or anything like that, you can watch professional reviews on youtube to get that information.  So all in all, this is a very premium Chromebook that meets all of my needs and does so in a very stylish manner.  I would highly recommend it if you have the budget for it.  If not, I would also recommend my old Acer R11 which was only 250 bucks and did everything it was supposed to do fairly well.

Big_dataset_951,Big_dataset,"All through college I had been telling myself, I would like to try a chromebook, but I needed too many windows dependent programs for my engineering classes to justify the expense.  Now that I'm graduated, I wanted something to replace my Samsung Note Tablet which was starting to show its age after years of faithful service.  I decided that because I often found myself wanting to type when using my tablet, a 2 in 1 would be a good option for me.I am so glad I took this plunge!I use it every day.  It's light enough to carry pretty much every where.It starts up, runs without issues.  Not long ago, I replaced the hard drive in my Toshiba laptop with an SSD, and in regards to speed and general ""snappy"" feeling, there was as much of a difference between the SSD and this as there was in the SSD upgrade over the hard drive.I love that I can let other people borrow my computer without compromising my privacy.  I also like taking it to work, logging into my managed G-Suite account and knowing that my work account can't ""see"" anything I do on my personal account.I mostly use it for playing a couple of games, surfing the web, managing my calendar/tasks lists, reading e-books, that sort of thing.  Between being able to do a surprising amount with chrome extensions and being able to run android apps on it, there isn't much it hasn't been able to handle.  It plays nicely with nearly everything I have wanted to do.  I even use MightyText to get and send text messages with it.The keyboard is small, a little weird and takes some getting used to, but I find myself actually preferring to use it over other keyboards.  People preferring tablet mode may want to consider the Samsung Chromebook Plus or Pro because the screen dimensions are more tablet like, but since I find myself using it mostly in computer mode and like having the option of the tablet, I think this screen is beautiful.  The resolution is great.  Even the speakers are way better than I expected from a 2 in 1 at this price point.I would recommend it highly to anyone who wants a light-weight device to use for work or play, especially if you can be flexible in the software that you use.

I bought it hoping that the stable Android channel would finally be available as it is advertised as running Android apps straight out of the box. That is currently a lie. You have to put the Chromebook on the Beta channel to run Android apps. Which has been a good experience so far. Outside of that, the keyboard is solid, the back lighting was not a selling point to me. But, has been a good addition. My first unit had a broken right speaker out of the box. And would whine. But, the replacement unit has been solid over the past few weeks. The speakers overall are not very good. Quiet and tinny. But, most of the reviews of the Samsung Pro and this unit warned of that. So, was not shocked by the lackluster sound. Track pad is passable. Not the best, not the worst. I think it should be better. Not too bothered by it overall. Screen is nice. Wish it was a touch better. But, again, it is on par from the professional reviews I read. I find it to be a little large when used in tablet mode.

This Chromebook can be your next Android tablet and you won't have to spring for the separate keyboard.  This device now provides the best of what a high-end tablet can do (with better specs here) in combination with the experience provided by a laptop. Unlike a standard Android experience, ChromeOS is centered around the Chrome web browser. This means that you don't need an app for Gmail, an app for hangouts, an app for gCalendar, etc. You access all these things via the browser the same way you do on your PC. If you need an app for something specific like a game or airline or TV viewing service, you have that option. This is really the best of both worlds!Samsung was close with their Chromebook Plus and Pro models but this Asus still ultimately wins the day in a couple of key areas. The keyboard and touchpad experience are pivotal for a device like this and what Asus delivers is very satisfying. Backlit, properly spaced keys allow even guys with large hands to use this keyboard comfortably in any lighting. The Asus is a bit wider than the Samsung models which have smaller more cramped non-backlit keyboards.You probably read that the Samsungs have a superior screen which according to the specs they do, but the 1080p delivered by the Asus is not only fully usable but more ideal for video and game content. The reality is that the 2400x1600 on the Samsung is not only NOT their recommended setting in the UI, it's barely usable anyway as everything on the screen is so tiny.  Asus didn't play these games and just gave you a perfect 1080 display.The Core M3 is a great workhorse CPU and should be the minimum spec you consider if looking for anything more capable than a standard tablet using a mobile CPU (ARM).64GB of storage provided in the Asus is also another clear winner with the others offering 32GB.The one advantage the Samsung provides in my view is the stylus pen. In tablet mode this could be very useful for drawing, collaboration or freehand note taking. I actually bought both and settled on the Asus.My only complaint so far on the Asus is that the screen in some places seems a bit hollow, if that makes sense. Tapping the screen in certain places actually knocks it against the rear of the cover housing, which produces a hollow sound. Something I can live with but  wish the screen was completely more consistent in this regard.

Only 4 stars because of the misleading page data. I'll set it to 5 stars if I can get ever get access to the Play Store on the stable channel. I waited a year fr the C1--PA to get stable channel Play Store access.Update: The C302 now supports Google Play Store services on the stable channel.. 5 stars now. There's little if anything i need to do with a portable computer that I can't do with the C302.

Big_dataset_980,Big_dataset,"Despite the Amazon description for this chromebook and pretty much any other resource out there (there are alot!!) saying this model is Android App ready, it is not. The OS will only update to version 59, and I believe it needs to be at version 60 to enable the Play Store on the stable channel. You can run the play store in the Beta channel, but I'm not a developer or product tester or techie who wants to risk the bugs associated with unstable channels. The ability to enable the Play Store was a HUGE plus for me to get this model, so needless to say this is a big disappointment.All that said, I still love this thing! I'm a writer and work pretty exclusively in Google Docs for all my editorial work and collaboration. One day I realized all the applications I use (save one) are web-based, so when my six year old Macbook Pro started acting up I decided to try a Chromebook.This laptop is extremely portable, which is a fantastic change from lugging around my old Macbook to coffee shops and libraries. The keyboard is AWESOME for writing. It's very, very similar to Apple keyboards. I didn't think I'd use the tablet or tent modes much, but now it's my favorite thing to watch Netflix on in bed because I don't have to support it with my lap or worry about it overheating. The build quality is incredible. It feels super solid and is a pleasure to use. So far the bluetooth works very well with my Bose Quiet Comfort 35 headphones.The only gripes I have with the hardware are small; the screen bezels are huge, which to be honest makes it look very dated or cheap, and the trackpad is often inaccurate.

A core m5 processor in this this is pretty much the fastest chromebook I have ever used hands down.  Of course it is light weight, all metal body, flips, tousch screen, charges super fast, battery lasts all day, and can run android apps (in beta mode).  But lets talk about the speed of this thing.  This thing is so fast it makes running 100 tabs super easy, and also playing HD videos or games is not a problem.  I think this is the best chromebook out there period.

The speakers are surprisingly good, and especially considering how much they get panned in the reviews. They are loud and clear which is all I need. I do not use the tablet mode like I thought I would so I cannot comment on that, other than it works as advertised. I do wish I could get some sort of keyboard cover for it in tablet mode. I do not like the feeling of the keys being pressed when I am holding it.Like most, the decision was between this and the Samsung Pro.

I was heartbroken to have to return mine, due to my not having done my reasearch thoroughly enough, and purchasing  my first-ever Chromebook without realizing I couldn't use it for a college web graphic design course. This is, in part, because I couldn't download GIMP (a free program similar to Adobe Photoshop), nor could I save my work to the Chromebook and upload to the college's online learning management system. So that part does illustrate what a long way the Chrome OS has to go to be a fully functional and affordable alternative to a PC or MacBook. If the price tag had been more in the $250 range, I would have kept her (yes, her) just for pleasure of the sleek design, solid build, ultra-light weight, and, for me, the key feature- a fabulous keyboard!! I love to type, and loathe tapping out emails on my iPad with my finger. This keyboard was perfect- not cramped and highly responsive.  I never really had the chance to delve into the world of the Chromestore apps, or whether Android apps would work, since I sadly had to return ""her"". I guess I have come to accept that Apple owns the app world, Google has maps and searches, Microsoft has Office and basic computer stuff, and Amazon has the e-reader and Echo world and that no one device seems to combine them all- but this little Chromebook came close!

Big_dataset_988,Big_dataset,"I absolutely love this Chromebook! This Chromebook was the first one that I have ever used and is a replacement for my MacBook Pro. I have found the MacBook to be too cumbersome to travel with and do not want to worry about it being stolen with all my data on it. So, I originally purchased this for the travel conveniences. However, after about a week of use, I can say that I will likely use this computer as my main computer even when I'm not traveling. I am more impressed with this than a top of the line MacBook Pro.Most of my love for this laptop is based on the operating system but since you get that with every Chromebook, I'll tell you what I like and dislike about the physical laptop only.Likes: The keyboard and trackpad are very similar to the MacBook and transitioning from one layout to the next was not very difficult. The display is perfect for me, plenty of brightness and a decent resolution that I couldn't tell much difference between this and a Retina display on my MacBook. The USB-C ports are nice and I found that a completely dead battery to fully charged time was about an hour. The battery life was something I never really worried about with my MacBook because I just usually kept it plugged in when I used it but the battery life on this Chromebook really does last so long that I often use it without a power cable in it and just plug it in at night to be ready for the next day. I really liked that this Chromebook came with 64GB of space but I really don't see how someone may fill that up unless they opt to sync their Google Drive offline or something. The microSD slot is extremely handy to expand upon your space if needed. I typically keep all of my offline files there and the speed of it is not noticeably different from the internal storage.Dislikes: I wish there were a caps lock key available but I do find that the search key is much more used than the caps lock so I don't miss it that much. I wish the display was able to go about 1 or 2 clicks brighter and about 1 click darker at the lowest setting. I find that the lowest setting of brightness is a little too bright for me when reading in bed. I wish ASUS provided a USB-C adapter for legacy devices. The speaker volume is decent but the quality of sound is terrible compared to my MacBook.Overall, I am extremely impressed with this Chromebook and would highly recommend this to others.

Seriously let's get over this ""we can get by on 64gb"" just give us plenty of storage space, this isn't 1998. Honestly 1/2 a terabyte wouldn't be too much. So with that said, I love the computer aspect of the device. The tablet is good also, however can't they design something that covers the keyboard during tablet mode. Who wants to finger the keyboard while using it as a tablet. Also design a bump proof case for the device as a whole. A mm piece of AL with magnets would be perfect to cover the keyboard during table mode.Update!!!!!!I've spent more time debating this product than I have any other item I have ever purchased I want this Chromebook to be a 5 star. It is the best Chromebook that I have ever used. It is fast, light, good battery life, lighted keyboard, great resolution, usbc charging, etc. The problem is that it is not a Chromebook. It is a convertible. If you just want a Chromebook, don't flinch, buy now. However, it you want a device that can be a Chromebook and a tablet, you might want to hesitate. It is very hard for me to get comfortable holding a tablet in your hand and feeling the keyboard on the back. I just know I am going to break a key any second. And, I just can't get over 64gb. For real, I have a nexus 7 that is over 4 years old with 32 gb, we doubled the capacity in 4 years, for real, what a disappointment. SD card is great, but not a good idea to install apps on an SD card, if that is even possible.ASUS, put in 128gb memory, a swivel to turn and rotate the screen so the monitor back faces the keyboard and lock it down and make all of the buttons and ports accessible from the side, so you can put on a protective case. And you have the perfect device. Basically a configuration that locks it in tablet mode. Then you have a perfect convertible device. Both forward and rear facing cameras would be nice too.

Big_dataset_998,Big_dataset,"Overall I would recommend this Chromebook for someone looking for the laptop-version of the Chromebook experience. If you want a overall great product purpose made to be a laptop first, a tablet/convertable second with very little disappointing aspects. While it's not the best laptop ever made, it's certainly up there and a great deal for what you pay versus a Windows (or Mac) laptop.Highlighting pros:- Amazing keyboard. I'm a keyboard fanatic and this was the deciding factor for a laptop for me. The keyboard is fully sized and comfortable (compared to Samsung's Plus/Pro which is terrible), the key travel is good with great action, backlighting is enough and adaptive. This rivals old Macbook and Thinkpad keyboards. Truly one of the best.- The aluminum build is firm and solid without feeling cheap.- The screen is great in all aspects.- Performance is solid for Chromebook use.- Battery life is great.What I can say about this Chromebook is that it doesn't feel like there were a lot of compromises made in parts and construction. Everything is either good or excellent in quality--compared to some laptops which have major downfalls like battery life or screen or keyboard. This feels like a Macbook in terms of enhancing the user experience by delivering a product that doesn't feel gimped by something.Highlighting cons:(Note, I have had this for several months and am a particular person, but I will still keep using this laptop as my main computer for several years regardless of the negative I give it)- There is coil whine, and from every C302 that has passed my hands (about 5) it's a consistent issue. It mainly occurs when the laptop is either charging or under heavy use (and/or both) where you'll hear a tiny, tiny screech or chitter under the keyboard. It's nothing to be worried about, quite common on fanless computers, and is better to hear than the loud whirl of a fan or hard drive running. I really wish Intel and laptop makers can work this out as fanless computers are becoming more popular.- Trackpad isn't the best. The surface isn't perfectly slick and can cause your finger to stutter if it's moist or greasy. I think this is the biggest problem to this laptop, but certainly isn't a terrible one compared to other trackpads I've used. And the touch screen helps remedy this.- The touch screen isn't as accurate as I wish, for cases like tapping tiny things around the edges. This is compared to a great tablet or phone. If you'll be using the touch screen more than the keyboard/trackpad, go for the Samsung Plus/Pro.- Screen brightness is generally ""enough"" but maybe not enough for watching dark movies in bright lights.- Speakers can ""chatter"" after playing youtube videos for a long period of time. Not sure what causes this, but pausing and playing stops it. This has happened on multiple C302s.- I wish Asus included some USB-C adapters in the box. Seriously, why not? At least a USB C to USB and USB C to HDMI.- Performance can be stuttering when under heavy load. If you're running music and documents and a youtube video and file transfers, things will stutter and stop and maybe even crash. Not bad considering it's a lower end, low power fanless CPU with 4gb of memory. Just learn to run fewer applications.- Software including the Play Store (beta) experience is a little slow on updates and the beta channel cuts out some nice features on the stable branch like the backlight flashing up when your hands hover over the keyboard.Again, overall I believe this is a great laptop with an amazing keyboard. It's got some faults, but not enough to distract most users or heavier users from enjoying the laptop or thinking it is anything less than the competition. I feel like I'm going to be happy using this laptop for years to come.

It has a light design making it easy for travel, reasonably small screen that makes it easy to use on your lap or in class, and a quality chassis to give it that nice premium feeling almost like a shiny Apple Mac. I have yet to run issues with too many tabs, videos, or other tasks running at the same time and thus this computer allows great management of the school or work purposes. Of course, with all Chromebooks runs the issue of al t of popular software not being available to this device such as Microsoft Office, however much of this software is easily replaced with the Chrome App Store and/or Android App Store. The biggest benefit with this computer for me is the longevity of the battery life with this thing. I am able to get around 2 days of use with this computer until I need to charge. This may be a higher end Chromebook, but it is perfect for the casual student or worker looking for a convenient laptop to simply edit documents, surf the web, share and organize files, and watch videos on.

It has enough friction to hold the screen at any angle but stiff enough so that the screen doesn't wobble a whole lot. (compared to the Acer R13 who's screen would wobble even from the slightest movements like typing let alone using the touch screen which would send it into a seizure)- The speakers are to the sides and not underneath so the sound isn't muffled when it's resting on something other than a flat surface- The Intel Core m3 is more than sufficient for this device. I haven't had any boggle down issues or lag even with lots of windows and apps running- This Chromebook has access to the android beta channel for android appsCons- This may be a personal preference but I did wish the screen was a tad bit brighter. By all means it works great in all lighting conditions but I do often find myself having the brightness setting anywhere from 75%-100%. And because of the constant usage of higher brightness, the battery does drain faster. Still can easily get through a whole day without charging though.- Just like many other Chromebooks the Bluetooth connectivity can still be problematic. Sometimes I have to disable and re-enable Bluetooth for it to find and pair with my device. Usually after pairing it works fine but when it comes time to reconnect my device the volume gets all low on me. It'll take me a few tries of turning my device on or off or disabling and re-enabling the Bluetooth in order for the volume to be back to normal.- The touch pad and screen are fingerprint magnets. They both pick up oils and such pretty easily. Both the screen and touch pad have a gloss finish so when there's oils from your fingers you pretty much see it right away. Not a huge bother for me but for some it's worth mentioning. I have a tempered glass protector for my screen so I can clean my screen often and still be able to preserve the screen without worrying about possible scratches, stains, and other normal wear and tear.Notes:- Please note (as least for mine that I bought from Amazon) that this Chromebook starts up in resolution of 1536x864. It is NOT 1920x1080 by default, you would have to go into display settings to change it.- Navigating to the android beta channel option is slightly tricky as in finding the setting isn't that obvious. Contact me if you need help finding this.Overall great Chromebook. I look forward to buying something like this again from Asus when they come out with one with even higher specs. (Intel Core M7 + 64gb maybe?)

Big_dataset_1028,Big_dataset,"So I have to start by saying I own both a ASUS 305UA and a Macbook Pro, both newish and both excellent but different. This Chrome book joins the group and is itself excellent and different. It is a very good machine, responsive and quick to start with a good solid feel to it. The trackpad and touchscreen are both excellent, the former being better than any windows machine I have used but not better than the mac, which is amazing so fair enough. The back-lit keyboard is a real help and worth considering (it was the deciding factor for me over the Samsung Pro). The keyboard is good, not quite as good as th Macbook but still excellent.The screen is bright and color spread is good. You might struggle a little in very bright sunlight but I was using it outside with no ill effects. I found I really like the ability to tent the computer and I use Bose quiet comfort bluetooth headphones which connected without effort (as did the soundlink). The speaker sound is OK but not great.The expansion slot takes a micro sd card and I added it to have both movies and music available for when I fly.  It played movies none stop on a seven hour flight. The insides don't need any more detail than acknowledging the fact they do everything you need without issue. I got a series of adapter for the USB C (Also off Amazon and cheap) but I found that most things worked well off either Bluetooth or wifi so I don't use them much.It isn't a Macbook or a windows machine. It is a Chromebook and like a mac or windows machine that means considering what you need. It is amazing and does pretty much everything I need to do in my actual life, at a fraction of the cost of equivalent quality and is way way better than a five hundred dollar laptop

Big_dataset_1029,Big_dataset,"Much has been written already in reviews, so I'll stick to two things: comparing it to the previous Asus Flip c100, and using a stylus with it (something people thinking about the Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro would be interested in).c100 Comparison:I've had this for only a couple days. It seems pretty fast. A lot faster than the c100. It's much smoother with web pages and android apps, and the touch screen is more responsive. It's still not quiiite as buttery smooth as a macbook pro (it's also only 20-30% of the price, which is crazy). For example, scrolling in a PDF is fast but not super super smooth. The build quality is a bit better than the c100. There's not as much flex, it's a bit more premium feeling. The finish is very very similar. Keyboard is a bit nicer, not tons. So yes, the build quality is way better than the majority of (plastic) chromebooks out there, but not way better than the c100 (because that's already pretty nice). As many have said, it approaches macbook pro build quality (and looks). Screen is slightly brighter than the c100 (not a lot), and slightly better (sharper). The difference is discernible, but certainly not a big difference. Again, a much much better screen than the TN screens on many chromebooks, ..but the c100 screen is also much better than those.It's significantly larger and heavier than the c100. One of the things I like best about the c100 is how ultraportable it is. Sometimes I forget it's in my bag. The c302 is a significantly bigger laptop. Feels like a 13"" to me, coming from such a small one. Bezels are much smaller on the c302, except the bottom one, ...but they're not thin bezels. I've included a bunch of comparison photos. Nearly identical thickness, although the c302 *feels* thicker/more substantial.Stylus:I ordered the Meko 2-pack, 2-type stylus (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E0LHE26). The c302's competitor, the Samsung Chromebook Pro, comes with a stylus. I went with the Asus c302 over the Samsung Pro because I was a bit concerned with the Pro's quality issues and the shorter battery life, ..and to a lesser extent the lack of backlit keyboard. But I did want to use a stylus occasionally for note taking/sketching. Maybe annotating pdf's. I had read in the comments of another review that the pointy/disc stylus type didnt really work with it. For me it *does*. In my experience with the apps I've tried so far (Keep android app, Kami PDF web app, and Sketchbook android app) *both* the point/disc stylus tip and the rounded metallic knob tip types work really well. If I'm writing quickly, there's a very slight lag before things appear, but nothing that will annoy me at all. One Note android app registered well and smoothly, but was more laggy. The way I see it, the main thing you're missing is the palm rejection that you get with the Pro (because it has a pen digitizer in the screen). For casual use, this will work fine for me.(fyi - all the styluses I've tried with the c100 [including this Meko, either tip] have been miserable and useless.) So I'm very happy and relieved to see it working excellently on the c302.Final, initial thoughts: For me, the computer is a bit bigger than I would like. Ideally, it would be a 11.5-12"" (not 12.5"") screen with minimal bezels, which would make it almost as small as the c100. The default scaling 1536x864 looks excellent and sharp to me. Holding it in tablet mode is awkard given it's size and weight - more so than the c100. However, most of the time if I want horizontal tablet mode I'll use the ""stand"" mode (keyboard face down in my lap, screen angled up). Portrait tablet mode works better than expected because it's thin, has a magnetic closure, and has a large side bezel. I'll try to update this in the coming days and weeks as I use this more. Feel free to ask questions. Overall I'm very happy so far ..just very stingy with my 5-star ratings. I might change it to a 5-star in the coming days.

Big_dataset_1031,Big_dataset,"I'm beyond satisfied with this Chromebook, it is stunning in every way.  I've waited over a month of use before reviewing.  I am not a light user, and I've yet to find any fails to do what I need from writing code (Caret, etc.), managing servers (ssh tools), connecting to other machines like my windows 7 that has to run certain things (via Chrome Remote Desktop which is very fast and responsive on this C302), watching videos, listening to music, and just good old surfing and working on documents, slides, etc.  It is a pleasure to view, type, and hold.  No problems with Play Store/Android apps.  I much prefer the 16:9 screen of the Asus compared to the Samsung CB Plus/Pro config, and I do not think that tablet mode in vertical orientation is odd at all, though I don't go to that mode very often (it's actually much more like phone screens in vertical...tall and narrow...very used to that already).I'll probably do some Linux dual-boot Crouton or Gallium kind of thing at some point, although I am having a hard time truly reaching boundaries so far just with the stock ChromeOS, especially since I can use CRD to other machines, ssh, or cloud dev tools in so many ways.  It's a great time to be alive!

Big_dataset_1035,Big_dataset,"I actually owned the Samsung Chromebook Pro for about a week before returning it and have had this for a couple of days. I will update if anything changes but my impressions are below. First, use case: I write a lot for work and use a Chromebook as my daily driver for notes, word processing, spreadsheets, etc.Here you go:1) The SCP screen is better but the screen on the 302 is pretty dang good-- you'll be pleased with 302's even if you've worked with the SCP screen. The 302 would be just about the perfect Chromebook if it had smaller bezels, though.2) The keyboard experience is so, so, so, so much better on the 302. The SCP keyboard is cheap, toy-ish. I have bigger hands and need a reasonable keyboard-- the 302 does a lot better than reasonable. The track pad on the 302 is also better than the SCP-- again, the SCP's feels cheaper.3) In Beta, the app store experience is smooth on the 302 while it is not on the SCP on the stable channel. Maybe there is a software fix to be had for the SCP but, to date, the 302 experience is much better. No lag with multiple apps and tabs open, unlike the SCP.4) While the SCP is smaller, the 302 is just as easy to carry around in one hand. It's also easier to place, hold on your lap because of it's slightly larger size.5) 302's battery life is on par or better than the SCP. Obviously, your battery life will vary, depending on usage.5) Overall, the 302 feels sturdier, has a better build quality than the SCP.I've read and watched lots of reviews, comparisons and most seem to say that the SCP is better overall. I don't see it, I really don't. It's an easy one for me: the 302 offers a better experience overall and it's not close.

Big_dataset_1036,Big_dataset,"This is a wonderful device.  The reality is you are getting the build quality of a $1000+ ultrabook for half the price.  It's sturdy, and looks and feels great.  I'm no expert on screens but I personally think the panel looks very nice.  It will reflect light though, but this hasn't been an issue for me as I'm primarily using it indoors.  Battery life appears good but will depend on your brightness and how much streaming your doing.  I was able to charge it quite rapidly with the USB-c charger and was about fully charged in an hour.  Boot time is basically non-existent.  The sound is decent but won't go overly loud.  I believe my Toshiba Chromebook 2 is capable of more sound but the Asus certainly isn't bad.I was surprised that I actually enjoy using this in the various modes.  The touch screen works quite well and I have found myself watching videos in tablet mode with ease.  You'll be surprised how intuitive and functional everything works with touch input in the Chrome OS.A word on Chromebook's coming from someone who is a fan of Windows 10:1. It has non existent boot times and updates are easy.  It will download in the background and require a restart whenever you're ready...which will take 1-2 seconds.  I know SSDs have greatly helped with most laptops, but there is no match for how fast you can get in and start doing things on a Chromebook.2. Yesterday I fired up the asus and was playing music in seconds. My windows 10 laptop was indefinitely loading something.  It was also telling me I'm out of one drive space.  It was also asking me to download some sort of app suite from acer. The Chromebook simply told me in a small tab in the corner that there's a new video from one of my YouTube subscriptions, which didn't effect anything.  It is for this reason that I believe windows 10 does best when you're plugged in and sitting somewhere with a mouse at hand, even as a laptop.  The Chromebook is great as a truly mobile device - take it anywhere, open it up, and do whatever you need to do without being hassled and within moments.  I don't know about you guys, but I don't always have time to mess around.3. You can do more then you think you can. Android Apps are coming. They work on this asus model in the beta channel (which can be activated in a few clicks). Sure, they're not perfect yet because they have to be optimized for the screen and what not, but they really round out the Chromebook and make it more useful.Example - I downloaded Citrix receiver and got into my work network from home.  I put in my working hours and found it odd that it worked better on this Chromebook then my computer at work.Really ask yourself what you need.

Big_dataset_1042,Big_dataset,"I did my research before purchasing and even had a Samsung Chromebook Plus in my hands before deciding on this machine. I have only had this machine for a day, so if I experience any problems I will come back and change the review.At the moment, it is everything it was advertised to be.Hardware - * Very solidly built and it transitions nicely from laptop to tablet mode. * The Keyboard was key for me and probably made the difference between the Samsung Chromebook Pro and this machine. I will primarily use this machine to write, so I need a nice keyboard. It feels very nice and I also really like the backlit keys in the dark. * The screen is more than adequate for me, although I have not used it outside much yet. It is as good or better than any laptop or tablet that I have had yet. Just for comparison, I have a 2009 Macbook and an Amazon Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX. I have also had a Nexus 7 tablet from Asus. I actually prefer the wider aspect ratio versus the Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro, because it feels closer to the Macbook that I have been using for years. * It certainly feels bigger as a tablet, and I will not use it in that mode to read books often, because I still have my Kindle Fire at home, but I love the tent mode for watching content or reading on a table. The hinges are very solid and hold well in either laptop or tent mode. Also, I prefer that balance on this machine versus the Samsung Chromebook Plus. I will use it primarily as a laptop and it sit very solidly in my lap or on a table.  * Battery - I cannot really speak to the battery life yet, but as a power user with lots of tabs and several apps open, it is giving me a days use 5+ hours of use so far. * The USB-C ports are working well, and I bought a multiple port adapter, which gives me a regular USB port along with a HDMI port an another USB-C port for charging. It worked right away, so I have all the ports I need.Software * ChromeOS was not robust enough to handle my day to day needs, so I was really waiting for the Play Store to be available, and switching to the Beta Channel was really quite easy. Now I have all of my Android apps (I have an Android Phone), and several of the paid apps work very well for me with no glitches. * In fact, I have not really found any software glitches yet. On app has crashed a couple of times, but it does the same thing on my tablet and my phone, so I don't think it is a problem with the Chromebook software. * ChromeOS on this hardware is running very quickly for me. The boot time is very minimal and everything has run very well. I don't game much so I cannot speak to how it would handle them. For writing, video watching, listening to podcast etc. it is working really well.The key for me going forward is how well it holds up. If it continues to work like this then it will fit my needs almost perfectly.Update:I have now had this Chromebook for over a month and it has become my primary workhorse. I prefer it to my older Macbook, which is now a desktop setup.Surprisingly to me, the tablet form has been better than expected for reading. It is large enough that in portrait setting, it can rest in my lap and I can see the screen fairly well. I have spent hours at a time reading in this mode quite comfortably.Several of the Android apps do have some minor glitches and will sometimes crash, but the machine is robust enough that they start very quickly, so the interruption is fairly short. All of the Android apps have worked, but not all of them have recognized the tablet so they do not all size correctly yet. Instagram for instance just gives me a smart phone sized box on my larger screen.As one of the other reviews mentioned, some of the touch features require a very small input and it can take several tries to get it. The worst of these has been closing tabs, where the input is right near the top of the screen and I almost always need 3 or more tries to get a tab closed when in tablet mode. In laptop mode the trackpad works very well for this.I use an adapter to to get a regular USB port and everything has connected just fine. In fact, I am very pleased that my Android phone connects right us and transfers files easily. I would expect this with Linux under both systems, but you don't always get what you expect.The sound is not real loud from the speakers, but I am reasonably pleased with the quality.On the whole, I am even more solid on my 5 star rating.

Big_dataset_1043,Big_dataset,"Best hybrid device if you want to replace a portable laptop and an Android tablet at the same time...I have been struggling with finding the perfect device for my needs over the last few months.  I needed a replacement for my Android tablet because it was too small (or my eyesight was just getting to bad for close-up viewing), and so I looked at 2-in-1 laptop designs.  At first I only looked at Windows devices because I didn't realize how far Chromebooks had come since their inception, and frankly I was a bit of a snob thinking they couldn't offer what I needed.  So I tried 4 different types of Windows devices:  two ""tablet"" types (HP Envy X2 and Acer Switch Alpha 12) - I won't go into details, but neither suited my needs.  Then I tried a few 2-in-1 ""flip"" style laptops:  Lenovo Yoga 720 and Asus UX360CA.  Again, both devices had their problems, especially when it came to dual booting Android (Remix OS - the Lenovo flat out can't do it, and the Asus just couldn't handle it and keep cool - although it came the closest to being usable).By this time I was getting pretty frustrated...until I just decided, on a whim, to look at Chromebooks, since nothing else was fitting the bill.  And that is where I discovered the Asus Flip (and also looked at the Samsung Chromebook Plus and Pro).  Torn between Samsung and the Asus, it came down to Android functionality for me.  The Samsung Pro still has a few quirks, and while it has a better screen, the keyboard suffers from a poor design.  So I decided to purchase the Asus Flip, and so far it has met every one of my nitpicky demanding needs, more so than any other device (Windows, Android or otherwise).Sorry for the long intro, so here is my review of this Chromebook so far:Build quality is very good, nearing the ""excellent"" mark, especially for the price.  Aluminum construction, no creaking or significant flexing, and still thin and light enough to be a serviceable tablet and an awesome laptop.  This is built better than the Asus UX360CA Windows 2-in-1, and that thing costs several hundred dollars more and doesn't have a backlit keyboard :P  The display is superb, with decent color range (not as nice as the Samsung Pro, but that is Samsung's bread and butter, and I would rather have a better keyboard from them, TBH).  I am liking the 16:9 screen ratio, as it is ""normal"" for laptop use, and also ""normal"" for older Android tablet formats.  I don't use tablets in portrait mode very often.Sound has been fine, except for a few issues with an Android app, and that can easily be software related as Android is still in infant stages (or at least toddler) on Chromebooks, and I expect those quirks will smooth out over time as Chromebook software is updated on a very regular basis.I love the USB C charging, and especially the fact that I can charge from either side so if I am using it in tablet mode or laptop mode, it can be plugged in on the side closest to the outlet.  Small thing, I know, but with traditional laptops sometimes you have the cord wrapped around your head or something weird because of where you are sitting :P  Also quick charging is great, super quick to charge up to full.  I have been taxing the battery pretty hard, but it has been showing decent numbers on time left.  Not a lot of experience with it so far, but I anticipate it will be just fine especially compared to similar Windows devices.The keyboard is very nice for me.  It is very similar to a normal Windows keyboard on a similarly sized laptop, and the keys feel good.  The keyboard itself is very solid, almost no flex, especially comparing it to the Asus UX360CX...  I wish that unit had had this keyboard, especially with the backlight.  Some people may say a backlight is no big deal, and they are probably right, but it is very handy at night or low light, and also just adds a little bit of class to the device.  Key travel feels good.  Overall very good compared to other devices like the Acer switch Alpha 12 and Lenovo Yoga 720.Software.  Chromebooks are up and coming, and there isn't much you can't do on these things anymore.  Sure, you are limited to one browser, but Chrome is well suited for most websites these days, and the apps and plugins are beyond compare.  While it isn't my favorite browser on a Windows machine (it is pretty resource intensive), it seems to operate just fine on the Chromebook.  And if I really want to view a website in another browser and not switch devices, the remote function to my Windows desktop works like a charm with almost no lag, so it will serve in a pinch.Android is running flawlessly so far, barring one minor incident with sound on Clash of Clans (which went away on reboot).  I also just got an update to non-Beta channel for the OS, although Play Store still says (Beta) next to it, I think Android is now running on this machine in the stable build.  I could be wrong, but for my experience, I didn't have to do anything special to enable the Play Store and it is working with no issues.Best of all, with Android, the laptop features work seemlessly with Android apps.  For example, screen rotation, disabling the keyboard and touchpad when in tablet mode, etc.  Those were not available options when dual booting into Remix OS on a Windows device (if you get it to work at all).  So even if you have a 2-in-1, there really wasnt a tablet experience available for them.  But this device goes from Android tablet to a pseudo-Windows laptop in a flip, and with no hiccups or other quirks.Performance:  so far I have mainly run a few Android games and browsing.  I have noticed a little bit of heat on the graphic intensive games, but otherwise the machine stays calm, cool, and collected.  No issues there, and I don't anticipate any since the Intel M3 processor is really overpowered for Chromebook functionality, and seems to be suited well to run Android so far (although that will depend on your app usage, or so I have heard).TLDR version:  perfect hybrid device if you want a light-weight laptop to browse, email, watch movies, etc, and also flip into Android tablet mode with a bigger screen than the normal Android tablet fare.  Quality is excellent so far, and the software/hardware combination works like they were made for each other (which is what you want :))

Big_dataset_1047,Big_dataset,"I am loving this device and I am a fairly picky tech geek. I've wanted a great Chromebook for a really long time now. And I have been waiting patiently to be able to run Android Apps on one. There is a lot of buzz about the Samsung Plus and Pro so I drove to Best Buy to see it in person. My gut reaction was that the Samsungs felt like a cheap plastic toy and I was really disappointed with how cheap they felt. I love my Samsung TV and so I was kind of hoping to have the same brand TV and Chromebook. But I don't want to pay $500 for plastic!Back on Amazon, I read a Samsung review and the customer referenced the ASUS 302. I had not heard of it before hand. To be honest, I was afraid to buy from a company that didn't seem like a BIG NAME. I mean, I have heard of ASUS, but people don't really talk about them. But the reviews were high and people liked the all-metal body. I wound up buying the ASUS 302 through another online store. I've had it for a few days now and I can't stop using it for both personal use and my business email, etc.Out of the box, before using it, you are supposed to charge it for 3 hours. So I did that. Then I logged in and opened up the Chrome Settings to change the operating system to the Beta channel, which then allows you to install Android apps.It feels really really solid. I mean, nothing bends. Nothing feels weak. It's great. Totally feels like money in my hand.It starts fast. I logged in and started to download my favorite apps, trying to make it as much like my phone as possible.As a tablet, it works just fine, but I really find myself using it in laptop mode the big vast majority of the time. Just easier that way, especially for tying anything.I like that the screen stays firmly in position no matter where you put it. I feared that it would easily fall backward, but it's just perfect.I like that it has a micro SD insert. I bought a 128gig chip and now I have way more space than I need for everything.The keyboard is very comfortable. The keys have that clicky feel, but without the clicky noise. They feel very firm in place, but very easy to type on. The trackpad is large and very responsive.I do love this thing, but any respectable review has some fair bit of negativity. So here are all of my picky gripes:1) No rear camera in tablet mode. There is a camera on the screen, and you can use it for a selfie or video conference. But when the device is folded in half, there's no camera facing away from you. Not a huge deal, but iPad has one, and so should the ASUS 302. Do I really want to be one of those people who holds up a giant table to take a photo? No, not really. But I was kind of hoping to maybe use the ASUS a lot more than my phone, and maybe even stop taking my phone with me lots of places. I want to be able to take photos if I have to.2) The sound is okay quality, but the volume is WAY too low. It's absolutely sufficient for just sitting and listening to a youtube video, or streaming music, when you are sitting right there with it. But my daughter's iPad Pro really has fantastic sound and volume. I mean the 12"" iPad sounds like a high-end boom box! Really it does. The ASUS has a small speaker on both the left and right side of the device. So... it's fine, but I am totally jealous of my daughter's ipad sound.3) When the device is closed, the android apps are all off. You'd expect that. However, I downloaded the Google Clock and set an alarm. It did not sound off when the device was closed. Also, I downloaded Google Voice, hoping that my device would ring when someone calls, but it does not. When it's closed, it's off. And that kinda sucks. When your phone is in your pocket, it's also, off, but the apps still alert you. The iPad also turns off, but the apps still alert you. When this ASUS device is in Tablet mode, and it's off, perhaps android apps will still function. I will have to test that and let you know.4) This is not ASUS fault, but a lot of very common google apps show up on the screen as phone-size. This is very inconvenient, and it's something the developers should take more time to reconcile. All that said, to be honest, most of the apps I care about also work very well as full size web pages and since I mostly use this as a laptop, I survive just fine. Google Keep and Google Calendar both open full size. Voice does not.5) If you are an artist and you want to draw on the screen, I will honestly tell you to buy an iPad Pro. Two things make the ASUS not idea for drawing. 1) There's a significant lag... I mean as you draw, the tip of your stylus is an inch ahead of the ""ink"" that shows up on the page. It's smooth, but just behind. Make sense? 2) There's no palm-detection, so your palm or hand resting on the screen will be picked up as a touch, and that interferes badly with your drawing. Personally, I will rarely if ever need to draw on the screen so this is not a big deal for me. But any serious artist would be bothered by the ASUS draw lag and lack of palm rejection.I think that's it. I am sitting here typing on the ASUS and really struggling to find something else to be upset about.As with a lot of devices, there's a big shift to USB-C. That's great tech. That also means I had to buy a dongle! I shelled out another $80 for a fancy dongle that let's me connect almost anything.... VGA, HDMI, USB, SD Card, Ethernet, etc. It arrives from Amazon tomorrow.

My son is going to take my new MacBook Pro with him to school and I needed to get a replacement.  Honestly, I didn't want to spend another $2,000 + on a laptop that I mainly utilize for Internet research and writing documents on Word.  Several people suggested that I look at one of the high end Chromebooks.  I did a massive amount of research and found that the ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA with 64 gigs was exactly what I wanted.  It only had to meet several requirements.... being able to work with my Seagate external hard drive; work with Office 365 or Office On-line and have the quality that my MacBook has.  This Chromebook not only meets those requirements it has exceeded my expectations.The screen is fantastic and it renders some of the highest quality images I have seen on a laptop.  I would say it is very close or equal to my MacBook Pro.  The Intel i3 processor simply flys... the machine is incredibly responsive.  I see absolutely no lag on videos or streaming content.  The keyboard is very similar to the MacBook and the keys are extremely responsive with just the right amount of travel.  The keys do have a bit of a rubbery feel to them.  I find it very comfortable.  The track pad, which I don't use, is also highly responsive. I did have to order a straight Bluetooth mouse as you have two USB-C type ports on the machine along with as Micro-SD card slot... but no slot for a Bluetooth dongle.  So your mouse has to be 100% independent.  Believe it or not, I am temporarily using my Apple Magic Mouse.  It only allows left and right clicking... no scrolling action.  But again, I ordered a Chromebook compatible mouse from Amazon.  Make sure you get a Bluetooth mouse that is fully compatible with Chromebooks.  I think I paid something like $16 for one that looks very much like the Apple Magic Mouse, but is fully Chromebook compatible and has received 4.5 stars in the reviews.Their is so much to talk about with this machine... the fact that it flips to become a tablet style unit, the great build quality (all aluminum chassis, top and sides), etc., that one would need to do a full video review.  Their are many on YouTube.  All that said, I would highly recommend this machine to anyone that works as I do... mainly on the web and with Word or Office type documents.

Big_dataset_1093,Big_dataset,"I've been waiting for this Chromebook for some time now and having only had it for about two weeks, I can say that the device and purchase were well worth it.  To start out, I'm a software engineer working in the realm of cloud DevOps, and multi-platform web and mobile application development. As much of my time is spent writing code as building cloud infrastructure in AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.  As such, I can defer a lot of horse power to those cloud services and keep my actual computer fairly lean.  After playing with a loaner Chromebook for a couple of months, I found the whole minimalist approach Google has taken with this platform to be totally refreshing, this Chromebook kits that up a notch and then some.Going to break this down into three parts: Hardware/Design, Use as a Stock ChromeOS Device, and Advanced Usage... In each section, I'll summarize the pros/cons and then at the end will provide a final summary. Hope this helps you get a good idea of what this Chromebook is capable of and why it's such a great buy.1. Hardware & DesignAsus has really set a new standard with the C302CA's internals and physical design. Internally this device is basically an entry-level MacBook.  A 12.5"" IPS screen that is gorgeous to look at, extremely bright and full 1080p resolution.  A solid little M3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of SSD storage make this machine capable of handling heavy usage and earn it a solid Octane 2.0 score in the 19000-20000 range. No slouch.The physical design is not just one of the best I've seen in a Chromebook but also in the general ""ultrabook"" form factor with comparable quality and design details associated with MacBook Air, MacBook, Asus' own Zen line, and Samsung's recent Chromebook Plus and Pro offerings.  The case is a solid aluminum billet structure with the now-ubiquitous scissor-action chicklet keyboard.  The surface texture of the case is a satiny paper-like touch, which is both clean and easy to wipe down, but also not so smooth that you have to be concerned with it slipping out of your hand when carrying it. While Samsung has gone with an iPad-esque rounded edge style with their Chromebook Plus/Pro lines, Asus has stuck with a clean, square edge design with subtle beveling reminiscent of miniaturized MacBook Pro 13"".  Even with the 2-in-1 flip hinge, the device has a solid feel and there's very little wobble in the screen while typing. The backlighting on the keyboard is a really nice treat and makes using the Chromebook in low-light settings a dream.When in the ""flipped"" form factor, you're effectively looking at a 12.5"" Android Tablet experience.  The pop-up keyboard looks just like the Android screen keyboard and the orientation detection and capacitive touch screen are snappy and very responsive.  One place that does frustrate me in the tablet mode is that ChromeOS has a number of UI features that don't lend themselves to touch interaction.  For example, the ""close-X"" button on tabs is very tiny and has a small hit-target area on the screen.  Similarly the task tray area of the main task bar is on the small side and lends itself to fat-fingering.  A simple OS update to make tablet mode ""beef-up"" certain UI components would give this a much more Android-like table experience. More on Android in a bit...The touchpad on the C302CA is the best I've used on a Chromebook to date. It has a glassy-smooth surface that resists finger-prints and goop, is very large, and has a firm but not too-clunky feeling click to it. It takes up more than 1/3rd of the palm-area horizontal space and makes thumb-tapping mouse tweaks very easy.  Likewise, the touch screen has a very nice responsiveness and I regularly find myself just deferring to the touchscreen for scrolling and quick button-clicks.Finally, there are the ports... and this is where I had the most trepidation about this machine. To keep the lean and skinny profile, Asus (like Apple) has equipped the C302CA with a whopping 2 USB-C ports (one on each side of the keyboard), a micro-SD expansion slot, and a headphone-mic jack.  The USB-C ports can act as the power-jack which is convenient when your power plug is sometimes on the left and sometimes on the right.  Unfortunately, if you're charging the machine, this leaves you with only one remaining USB-C port.  I've purchased a multi-port hub that provides a pass-thru USB-C plug, 2 USB3.0-B plugs, and ethernet jack, and an HDMI-out port. I velcro it to the back of the screen and remove it when I'm using the device in tablet mode (since I usually don't need it wired up in tablet mode).  It gets the job done, but running $50-100 for a good dongle like this, you're adding to the TCO of the device if you need more connectivity than a single USB-C port.The battery life on the C302CA is no joke, either. I've been getting regular 10-11hr usage times between charges and it can get back to fully charged over the USB-C ports in about 2-3hrs.  Really in-and-of-itself that's a great feature by just reducing the need to always lug around a power-brick.Pros:- Internals are very performant and well-spec'd for the entry-level price point of this Chromebook- The physical case is solid and of a production quality you'd expect in machine 3-5x the price of this machine- Beautiful, bright IPS Screen with full 1080p resolution- User interfaces that are tight, responsive, and comparable to Apple grade quality- Backlit keyboard rocks- Battery life is pretty amazing at 10-11hrsCons:- 4Gb RAM cap... Rumor has it Asus will be releasing 8Gb and 16Gb variants down the road... this will be a good thing for power-users- Many UI elements are not user-friendly in tablet mode- Port minimalism... two USB-C's pretty much guarantees your going to be investing in a could adaptor/hubs to carry around wtih you2. Stock ChromeOS UsageOut of the box, the Asus C302CA is a powerhouse for stock ChromeOS usage.  The general mantra of ChromeOS is that the web/cloud is your primary application interface and stand-alone applications are really just web-applications bundled up as Chrome browser Apps/extensions. Initially, this may seem like a limiting scope for being able to get actual work done beyond just web-surfing.  But with a host of solid productivity suites on the web these days (Google Mail/Docs/Drive/Calendar, MS Office365, and Apple iCloud Apps), you can actually do a major amount of your day-to-day productivity activities with a Chromebook w/ having to install a single copy of anything to do it.For more advanced usages, there are now a number of cloud-based development toolkits and graphics tools available to make a stock ChromeOS system a capable web development environment. I have a stack setup right now with GitHub for source control, Cloud9 for development environment/terminal access, and a couple of AWS services for code assembly and deployment to a dev cloud server.  All and all, it's a light weight, but very robust development stack, that also has the added convenience of Cloud9's collaboration features wherein multiple developers can be writing code in even the same file simultaneously.  Much like collaborative editing in Google Docs/Spreadsheets, but in code itself.  Great for pair programming, code reviews and group refactoring sessions.Performance-wise, I can easily have 12-24 tabs open simultaneously and see no slow-down in performance.  On occasion a tab may freeze up on me with the ""Uh-oh!"" message, but this is no more regular than what I've experienced with the Chrome browser on Mac, Linux and Windows systems.  I've fiddled with some web-based games, but the graphics capabilities while decent for this form factor, you won't be playing any intense games in stock ChromeOS mode.Where ChromeOS really shines and what I think is going to be a very significant deal-maker for these devices in the coming year is the inclusion of the Google Play Store and the ability to run Android applications in the ChromeOS environment.  You do have to be on the developer channel of the OS to get this feature, but there are a number of guides in the ether that explain how to set it up.  As the owner of an Android phone, I really like this feature since I can load apps onto the Chromebook that I regularly use already, apps I've paid for are available on this device, and the Play Store accurately recognizes the C302CA as a ""tablet"" form factor and will suggest the tablet alternative of many apps.  Thus far, I've loaded a number of games, my password vault, several productivity apps, Skype, Spotify and some network scanning Android Apps and they've all worked very well.  On occasion with graphically intensive apps, like games, there can be some masking artifacts around graphics and sprites that can easily be fixed usually just by restarting the app.  I'm really looking forward to where Google takes this in the coming years as it looks like they're trying to find the ideal balance between ChromeOS and Android... An AndroidOS, if you will.One place that I find lacking in ChromeOS is the settings management.  For the most-part you don't have much freedom to make any significant changes to settings.  Mouse and Trackpad settings are very minimalist, there's no way to modify short-cut keys, and the power management options are pretty minimal, too. All and all, they are simple devices, but it would be nice to have a more immediate access to deep config settings.One of the features of ChromeOS that I find very convenient is the way in which all of your configuration settings are stored in the cloud with your gmail account.  When I grab my daughter's Acer R11 or borrow a coworker's Chromebook, all I need do is login with my Google account and within seconds I've got the same user experience I get anywhere else in the GoogSpace...Pros:- Clean and secure operating system that is very lean and gets the most out of the systems modest specs- With the combination of web-based productivity tools and development apps/services, this Chromebook can provide a breadth of very viable usage scenarios without bogging the system down with locally install applications.- Android Apps and Google Play Store are real game changers for the ChromeOS landscape... Suddenly, one device can effectively serve as a platform for two different application topologies.  And the Google Play Store is chock-full of great apps and games.- Boot time, sleep time and wake time are crazy fast... There's never a long, finger-tapping wait for the system to come up.Cons:- System settings could be more robust and better organized- Tablet-mode still needs some work... It's definitely a work in progress, but with more 2-in-1's entering the market, I'm expecting there will be significant feature enhancements around tablet-mode.3. Advanced Usage[WARNING: Here there be dragons!!! The following options require you setting up your Chromebook in ""Developer Mode"" which requires a full factory-reset.  This in-turn provides features that are normally disabled in ""Normal"" ChromeOS mode.  Venture at your own risk/responsibility...]So, this is where this little Chromebook REALLY shines... As I mentioned in the intro, I'm a software engineer and while I love the liberation and simplicity of the ChromeOS experience, there are still times where I want some more classic applications like you'd find on MacOS, Linux, or Windows.  Luckily, there are a number of ways to accomplish this and there's a healthy developer community regularly making new tools and options.  Since ChromeOS is itself a Linux platform that's been pared down to a very simple and low-overhead system footprint.  This gives us several ways to get a more fully-featured desktop experience:a) Chroot/Crouton Linux Desktop Installationb) Chroot/Crouton/Xiwi Embedded Application Launcherc) Dual Booting into Linux DesktopThe first two options are very similar and only differ in the way in which you interact with the Linux environment, while the third option is quite literally installing a full installation of Linux onto the machine and booting directly into it instead of ChromeOS.  Without going into too much detail (seriously, google or wikipedia 'chroot' if you want the bloody details), a ""chroot"" is a parallel installation of an operating system in it's own isolated ""container"" in the ChromeOS operating system. It's neat because it let's you run both ChromeOS -and- a Linux Desktop OS like Ubuntu at the same time (!!!). The chroot installation is actually sharing number of resources with the ChromeOS operating system, making it still very resource conservative.Crouton is an opensource script that makes the creation, installation and management of one or >many< chroot installations a breeze. With the Crouton script and a decent internet connection, you can very easily have Ubuntu or one of it's many variants installed in about 10 minutes.  Once installed, you just need to press Ctrl-Alt-Shift-FwdArrow and you'll be in a running Linux desktop... -BackArrow to hop back over to ChromeOS.  It's really seamless and smooth to move back and forth and makes experimenting with different Linux configs and environments effortless.In addition to this first full-desktop chroot approach, Crouton offers another installation method that lets you run Linux in a ""headless"" mode where there is no desktop environment, rather the Linux OS forwards the application windows to the ChromeOS desktop.  This is accomplished by installing the ""xiwi"" packages into the Linux chroot and adding a ChromeOS extension that exposes the ChromeOS desktop interface to the Linux chroot.  When all is said and done, you can setup an application launcher which will bootstrap and app on the Linux chroot and then open it in a window on the ChromeOS desktop.  Iv'e used this method to install VS Code, Arduino IDE, and a 3D printer host application in this ""embedded mode"" and it's very functional and comfortable  to have everything in the ChromeOS experience and just consume the resources needed to run the application and nothing else.  It's worth noting that there is a performance hit with this approach, namely that the forwarding of the application window to ChromeOS comes at the cost of losing accelerated graphics rendering for the Linux apps.  While I can run Minecraft in a full-desktop chroot of Xubuntu with a very good framerate and rendering, when I use the xiwi approach here, the game is nearly unplayable.  That being said, for code editors, general productivity and networking apps, and just a basic XTerm, this approach works just fine.Finally, there's the most performant but also most disconnected from ChromeOS approach of installing a full Linux OS in a separate partition on the machine's system drive or microSD drive.  I've done this using the excellent GalliumOS which is an upstart opensource distribution based on Xubuntu that pares down the OS footprint, adds appropriate graphics drivers and memory management configurations that make it zippy on a small system like this one, AND adds a number of touch, keyboard, and 2-in-1 friendly features. This installation has a lot of pep in it... Apps start very fast, graphics are much more responsive and capable when not being shared with ChromeOS and there are a number of ways you can tweak the UI/UX to your own liking.  I haven't tried it yet, but there are reports that Steam-based games can be run on this sort of configuration, but with a limited number of hardware applicable games.  Again, this isn't going to be a gaming mega-machine.  You also sacrifice not having access to the Android/Play Store features.  But if you're looking to run an app that needs all the resources, like Gimp or a Java IDE, then this is the way to go.  Having a zippy 128GB microSD card to mount for system storage on the Linux side is convenient too because you can also mount it from a chroot Linus installation on the ChromeOS side so you can share files and config across the various installation types.If only for the dual boot option, I'm actually looking forward to when Asus actually releases the 8GB and 16GB models as I'd actually consider that to be a worthwhile since it would open the possibility of hypervisor'ing virtualbox and docker containers with serious resource availability.  All that being said, you get a lot of bang for the buck with these three enhanced desktop/application options and I use all three in some capacity every day, so don't think your'e isolated to just one approach.4. SummaryIn conclusion, the Asus C302CA Flip Chromebook is hands-down one of the best new offerings for Chromebooks in 2017 up there with the Samsung Plus/Pro models, and some of the new HP models.  Build quality is amazing and not just a plastic, toy-like assembly, but a solid unit with high-quality parts through-and-through.  As a stand-alone, stock ChromeOS device, the C302CA performs as well as Chromebooks in the $800-$1000 price range and provides more than enough options as just a web-application and Android app platform. If you really want to get the most out of this little wonder, then the options for installing Linux OS in various forms and integrations is solid and has outstanding opensource and community support in GitHub, reddit and Google Groups. When adding that ""secret sauce"" this machine goes from being a basic ChromeOS device to a fully-featured development platform... for only about $450-$500.  By comparison, the entry level Apple MacBook has the same CPU, same graphics chip, comes with 8Gb more RAM, a 256Gb SSD, but a lower-resolution screen, and no touch or 2-in-1 features... for $1300.  You won't be disappointed with this great little machine how ever you end up using it, and that versatility is what really makes this machine such a fun and valuable computer.I'd also recommend that you consider the following items for accessorizing your C302CA:a) Vinyl Skins - There are a vast number of very beautiful skins available for this model that provide protection for the screen cover, keyboard face/palm rest, and screen bezel.  While the stock aluminum case is darn solid enough, it can take scratches easily from things like keys or cable connectors tossed in a bag with it.b) Anti-glare Screen Protector -  The glossy glass screen cover is beautiful, but it has two drawbacks: it's a mess of a fingerprint magnet and it's so glossy that in outdoor environments or spaces with a lot of stray light from windows, the screen becomes a glare-reflecting mess.  For ~$15 you can get a nice, fitted anti-glare screen protector that reduces the fingerprint/glare problems AND gives you some piece of mind about protecting that gorgeous screen.c) USB-C Expansion Dongle - There are a number of them out there to address this port-minimalism trend.  If you want to use a mouse/keyboard with a USB-A style wireless dongle, plugin an external HDD, display to an external monitor, or use an ethernet hardline, you're going to need one of these.  Expect to pay $50-$125 depending of features a build quality.  Don't skimp on USB-C devices, they handle a ton of current and you don't want a cheap hub toasting your USB bus.d) A Bluetooth Mouse - While this unarguably has one of the best trackpads in Chromebook Land, there are still times you just need the precision of a mouse... ChromeOS supports Bluetooth 4.0 and LE devices and there are a lot of nice, slim-style mice out there similar to Apple's Magic Mouse that are BT and don't require a USB dongle.e) 64GB/128GB/256GB microSD Card - The only way to expand this machines internal storage is through a microSD card.  You could conceivably  install a USB 3.0 type-A low-profile memory stick on a USB-C adaptor, but that would be silly.  With many of the high-performance microSD cards getting to 90-100mb/s read-write speeds, these drives can be used for all sorts of things, like storing music, videos, photos and the likes on a shared device.f) A Capacitive Touch Pen - I prefer the kind that are active tip charging so that you can have a very fine-point, but still register contact.  Helps with dealing with miniscule UI elements when in tablet mode.Hope this has helped you make a decision and happy computing!

Big_dataset_1094,Big_dataset,"I really can't explain how pleased I am with this purchase.If you've ever used a Chromebook, you may have been disappointed at first.  You may have thought to yourself, where are all the apps!??  I did, too.  Only 'links' to your Google products are available, along with Chrome extensions.BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!!!  Now if you go into your 'about Chrome OS' settings and change your Chromium version to the Beta Channel, you'll now have access to the Play Store and it's full library of Android apps!!!  I immediately installed my games, bible, Plex, Kodi, and other apps just to make my Chromebook a little more fun!Size-wise, this thing is almost weightless.  I compare it to my wife's 13 inch macbook pro.  The screen is almost the same size, yet the device itself seems tiny in comparison.  The aluminum unibody looks and feels the same, as does the backlit keyboard.  They really do look like near-clones of each other: like Dr. Evil and Mini-Me.Only gripe is that the Android App feature is still in Beta.  It has some bugs they are still working through.  I also am a bit bummed that it has only USB-C ports.  There's hardley any USB-C devices out there, so I will have to get me some converters in the meantime, or resort to buying the more expensive devices (we all know that the 'newest' form factor is always the most expensive).

Big_dataset_1095,Big_dataset,"First off, I'm going to assume you understand what Chromebooks are and their strengths & weaknesses, with the OS. I will just review the hardware.This is finally the Chromebook I've been waiting for, that is not a $1300 Pixel. The build quality is on par with Macbooks and other high end laptops. The keyboard is excellent (and backlit). The track pad is excellent. The action is smooth and tight with no rattling. The screen is excellent...the aluminum casing is well designed, and the flip hinges are solid, but smooth. There are only two things that are less that amazing, and they're minor. 1. The bezel around the screen is still very wide. They could have easily fitted a full 13"" screen in the same lid. 2.The only ports are 2 USB-C ports. They absolutely function perfectly, but require that you re-purchase all your peripheral cables if you're not completely on the USB-C bandwagon already. It would have been nice to have even 1 legacy USB-A 3.0 port to ease that transition. But those two items aren't really failures...just the only two things I found that could be improved upon. Otherwise, this laptop is really fast and snappy...runs Android apps...and generally does everything that a Chromebook does, excellently. If you're considering it, fear not. This laptop performs in every way.

Big_dataset_1096,Big_dataset,"I really liked this computer except for one thing...it is a Chromebook.  I have always used PC and the jump to a Chrome OS was just a bit too big for me to make.  For instance, I couldn't get full version of MS Office and the tablet version that is available gives up a lot of functions I use in the regular version.That said, if you know the limitations of a Chromebook and want one, this is a great package!

I am loving chrome OS, and love using chrome as general platform.I wouldn’t buy this book primary for using android apps, as play store is only available in beta channel, and most apps are designed for mobile stage. I rather use chrome for almost all services, as it works phenomenally. All hardware aspects: screen, keyboard, and build is very beautiful- worth the price.
            ",5,
Big_dataset_1099,Big_dataset,"For those still on the fence - this chromebook is a Must Buy - if you can find it at the right price ($499.00).  Don't succumb to price gouging.  With a little patience, and willingness to leave the cocoon of Amazon Prime two-day shipping, this chromebook can be snapped up.  I would've preferred to buy form Amazon, but I ended buying my chromebook from another retailer because the Amazon pricing was too uncertain, along with availability/shipping.So, I have had this chromebook for nearly two months and I am happy with Asus and disappointed with Google.  Asus has a jewel of a chromebook here.  It is beautiful to look at and the all-aluminum build is top-notch.  One feature that sets this chromebook apart is the 64gb capacity.  So far, Asus is the only the second manufacturer to offer a chromebook with 64gb of storage - the other manufacturer being Acer.  With the promise of Android app access on the horizon, 64gb is the minimum capacity that I want from a chromebook.  While most chromebooks also offer microsd card storage, that is no substitute for internal storage.  Another feature that sets this chromebook apart is the backlit keyboard.  First, the keyboard is a pleasure to type on.  There is adequate key spacing and travel.  Since the chances of me using a software keyboard are slim to none, the keyboard quality is of the utmost importance.  The backlighting has proven to be extremely useful and that is something that is not available for other chromebooks in this price range.  The backlighting even has five levels of adjustability!Some tech journal reviews have noted that the Asus display isn't quite as good as the Samsung Plus chromebook display.  I realize that in comparison to the Samsung Plus, it has lesser vibrance, lesser color accuracy, and a narrower color gamut.  That's not apparent unless I am looking at them side-by-side, however.  I like the Asus display.  YouTube videos look good, along with Hulu and Netflix.  That's what I care about.  Could they look better?? Probably, but for me, they look ""good enough.""  If I want the ""fabulous"" screen experience, I can always chromecast video to my television.I really like the touchscreen on this chromebook.  It is very responsive and a must for the full Android apps experience.  This chromebook also promises ""flipping"" and does not disappoint as the hinges are very sturdy.  I regularly convert my laptop to tent or presentation modes with absolute confidence.  There is a tiny bit of play in the screen from the hinges, but I think that is a good thing, as it keeps the laptop from being too rigid.  I'm not likely to use this chromebook in tablet mode, however, becasue the 16:9 aspect ratio makes that mode a little too unwieldy.I love how speedy my chromebook is.  From off to on takes all of three seconds (if that).  The 4gb of ram that ships with this machine is put to good use.  Another feature that I really love are the two USB-C ports.  Some have complained about the absence of USB-A ports, but I think the C ports really future-proof this machine. The addition of the micro sd card slot covers the rest of the bases.So that brings me to the hiccups.  Google promised that all chromebooks released in 2017 would have Play Store access.  The Asus shipped in January, so the expectation is for that access to be included.  But the Play Store experience has been mixed, at best.  Early in February, the Google Play Store was on the Asus in the Chrome OS stable channel.  The Play Store on the stable channel nearly made my chromebook unuseable.  There were constant force closings and crashes .  Access was pulled from the stable channel without warning by Google.  It was even pulled from the beta channel briefly, but returned.  I think the Intel core m3 chipset creates some inherent conflicts with Google Play Services and Android apps.  I have only anecdotal evidence to support my assertion, however.  I have heard that those chromebooks using Arm chips seem to have an easier time with Android apps.  Also, my first chromebook was an Acer r13, which runs with an Arm-based chip (Mediatek).  Play Store access for Acer is available only through the beta channel too, but that access has been far more stable on Acer than it has been with Asus.  When I was running pure Chrome OS on the stable channel, my Asus worked brilliantly - extremely fluid and fast, with no crashes.  Last month, I enabled Play Store access through the beta channel.  It's not nearly as bad as it was when the Play Store was on the stable channel, so I can live with the experience (so far).  Even as I am typing this, however, I have gotten numerous messages saying ""unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped.""  I have come to hate this notification.  It shows up in the middle of the screen and dims everything until I click ""report"" or ""ok.""  Very Annoying for this message to show up while I'm watchng a movie.  Chrome OS used to crash, so there has been some improvement, but the annoying notifications (which can't be turned off, BTW) show that Play Store access still has a ways to go (I guess that's why the Play Store is still in beta status).Pure Chrome OS has a lot to offer over Windows ad Mac, in my opinion.  It's light, fast and is much more secure, in my opinion.  The addition of Android apps ups the ante even further.  If you are at all interested in Chrome OS and chromebooks, I think this is the chromebook to get.  Don't let the on again - off again experience with the Google Play Store deter you.  This chromebook has the best array of features for the money.  Also, I guess I am really hoping - expecting - that Google is going to solve the Play Store access issues that seem to be plaguing chromebooks with Intel chipsets. My Asus is a great chromebook when it runs Chrome OS in the stable channel and I expect it will become an even greater vehicle for Android apps when Google solves its issues with the Play Store.

I thought all I needed to do was import my .ovpn file and I would be all set, but that's definitely NOT the case.  Various instructions online tell you to break apart your ovpn file, or how to create and download the various ca, client and key files, then convert them, then import them, then etc. etc.  I've been doing this for a long time and I'll probably eventually get the right files and configuration in place to make that VPN connection, but I was a bit surprised how much it reminded me of the earlier VPN days (late 80s early 90s, I know I just dated myself) when it was a crap shoot and just like this to try to get VPN working.  I shouldn't really have to take 4 or 5 files and manipulate them and/or upload them to get this to work.For now, at least I've got this ChromeBook in Beta mode and the OpenVPN Google App does work, but realize only Google Apps will communicate across this VPN connection.  The native Chrome browser will not, nor will any ChromeOS apps will communicate across this OpenVPN connection.  At least that was for my case.Don't get me wrong though, I love the battery life and 95% I'm happy chugging along, but every once in a while this rears it's ugly head.  I took a look at the ChromeOS feature requests and updates and it just seems like posts on this feature have gone stagnant so just realize you'll have to jump through some hoops to get this to work for at least the present and near future.  If I do get it to work i'll try to write up an in depth how to using the latest OpenVPN AS.

Big_dataset_1119,Big_dataset,"After looking over windows and mac laptops, I decided to go with the less expensive and well reviewed Chromebook.Right away I noticed that I could do almost anything you can do on a much more expensive laptop..I had no problem building my new website on WordPress, or creating spreadsheets and writing blog posts for the website..Games ran amazingly good that I downloaded from google play, and most ran without an issue whatsoever! Pairing a Bluetooth controller also wasn't an issue. After 2 months in with it, there is no looking back! I absolutely know I made the right decision to go with a Chromebook! I see people at coffee shops and laugh knowing that they paid 5 to 6 times as much as I did to do the exact same things as me. Get this, you won't regret it!

I've used other Chromebooks (granted, less expensive ones) that had lag or cheap feeling keyboards but this one is snappy and has a very solid feel. Setup took only a few minutes and I was up and running. Battery life is fantastic giving me over 8 hours easily with moderate usage. I knocked off a star for build quality control. So much is done right yet the screen doesn't align properly with the base when closed. It's a small issue and something many may not notice but it's something I can feel every time I pick up the notebook when it is closed.

The battery life is ""very good"" and gives me 6 hours of video with another couple of hours to spare. I'm sure it will come close to it's 10 hour stated time limit but also realize that batteries do decline with age so it's good to have a longer life than needed.The keyboard is excellent and is (for me) better than the one on my MackBook Pro as I make less typos right from the start. The touchpad was almost a deal breaker at first but after I cleaned my dirty hands and used it for a while the tactile stickiness of the pad mostly went away and gets better with use. It will never quite match my MacBook Pro's glassy smooth touchpad but is more than good enough compared to other notebooks I have used. It is much better than what was available a few years ago on Windows laptopsNit picks: Screen calibration a little warmer than I would like but works well with video. Wish the speakers were better but what can you expect from a small laptop.

Big_dataset_1124,Big_dataset,"This is an update on 6/4/2017 to the review below:After living with this machine for a couple of months, most of my comments still apply, but I would have to say the speakers are a definite weakness. If you watch a video in ""tent"" mode, the speakers, which are located on the sides of the case adjacent to the touch pad, and aren't particularly loud, are situated behind the screen and are hard to hear.----------------------------------------------------This is my second chromebook. My first was a Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015, which made various ""best of"" lists when it came out. I purchased the Asus mainly for the touchscreen, and honestly, for the excuse to buy a new gadget. I plan to give the Toshiba to a family member.For me the Toshiba was something of a revelation. It has a beautiful display and nice keyboard, and it is fast. It was my first introduction to ChromeOS, which I like very much. We have used it quite heavily for a little more than two years. It has virtually replaced our tablet for just about everything we do on those kinds of devices. It is quite useful for remote connections to work computers.The Asus in some ways is an incremental improvement over the Toshiba. It is somewhat faster (~21K vs. ~15K on the octane benchmark). The wifi on the Asus is also a bit faster. The displays and keyboards on both machines are excellent. I would give the Asus touchpad an edge, but not really by much. The battery life on the Asus appears to be longer, but not dramatically so. The touchscreen on the Asus is potentially a bigger improvement, but I haven't really got used to using it. The Asus is a bit lighter and smaller, including the screen. The Asus looks a little nicer with its metal case, and the construction feels a bit more solid. On the other hand, the Toshiba has stood up to a lot of use, including getting hauled along on multiple family vacations packed into both checked luggage and carry ons, and in the car.All in all, I am happy so far with the Asus, but I'm not sure it is worth the somewhat premium price, which is my reason for giving it only 4 stars. The Toshiba cost ~ $300 and I purchased the Asus for $499 at Newegg (which was the only place I found it was in stock at the time, so it appears to be quite popular). In time, I hope the touch screen will prove to be more useful than I've found it to be so far, especially as I look into using Android apps. In the mean time, I will say that the Asus is very nice, but is missing the wow factor, especially for the price - but maybe I've just been spoiled.

The screen is great, the computer is fast, and looks great with the aluminum case.I have enabled the Google Play store in beta environment for the Chrome O/S. The applications that I use most (mainly video apps like Netflix) seem to work acceptably. You can download videos from Netflix and Showtime using the respective Android apps. Because of the size of the screen (12.5""), one uses the chrome browser instead of needing to use an Android application in many cases compared to a cell phone.In the time that I have had the computer, I have seen a steady improvement in Android support in the Chrome O/S beta environment.BTW: If you want to run Android applications on a chromebook, be sure to get at least 64GB of internal storage (not counting the micro SD card). At this point, Android apps cannot access the micro SD card data (April 2017) so you need to have enough internal storage to store Chrome O/S (and data) and Android system, applications, and data.

I have over 100 employees, and while not all of them get computers, I buy computers for about half a dozen employees as well as parents, friends, and my other half... so I've probably purchased around 40-50 computers in the past few years.Wow - just wow.  I have been a die hard fan of my Chromebook Pixel 2013 model which I still have, and also my Chromebook Pixel 2 2015, which I also still have and love.  I've kept those because they have the best screens on the market, they have a crazy fast Octane benchmark score of 26,000 and 29,000 respectively... only problem was that they're expensive.  So I ordered this after reading about decent benchmark scores, a great backlit keyboard, and the fact that it 'flips' into a tablet.  So the verdict: a great computer... now my Pixel 2013 will go to an employee of mine, then I'll order another one of these for my other half and then hand down the Pixel 2 2015 to another employee... I just can't believe that these are taking so long to get in stock, so until then I'll have to order from warehouse deals and make sure that they work well.Octane score on this is around 22,000... screen is great, flip works great, keyboard is incredible, sound is actually pretty good, and battery lasts at least 10 hours right now... but goes to sleep pretty quickly which means that I can get an entire day on one charge, probably 2 days if used for work where I need to pick it up to check on some things, then put it down again.Definitely a 5-star computer, I'd recommend this to anyone.... especially someone buying for their parents or their employees... you just don't have to worry about anyone messing up a chromebook, or getting viruses, or having to install apps or anything... they just work, and work extremely well.

But when I received the email, it would not print and the status of the label was canceled.

Not only that, but there was NO COMMUNICATION about what they did (or in this case, did NOT do) to try to fix it. Very disappointed in very bad tech support. I'll have to contact them again.

I weigh up the Pros and Cons as follows.CHROMEBOOKㆍintegrated keyboard (with 5 stage back-lit keys) / track padㆍOS upgrades for 5 year minimum (a Google promise)ㆍAndroid Marshmallow out of the box (Nougat on the way)ㆍfar quicker boot-up timeㆍversatile dual laptop / tablet modesTABLETㆍfingerprint scanner (a few models)ㆍSIM card support (some models)ㆍGPS (some models)ㆍAndroid widgetsㆍlighterCompared to a tabletA no-brainer for me, and I haven't looked back. A Chromebook can do all the things I want out of a tablet, and give me the convenience of a laptop for text entry when the need arises (like writing this review). A light Chromebook (which I think this is) will always be heavier than a light tablet. So I think that'll be the first decision prospective buyers will have to make.As a ChromebookThe Asus Chromebook Flip C302 is a wonderful piece of tech. It wreaks of quality. The screen is lovely, the keyboard is just great, and its as quick as lightening. The battery is quick to charge, and lasts ages.I did some comparisons with the Samsung Chromebooks. The Plus has a weaker processor, so I didn't even consider that. The Pro has the same processor, but a better screen and an integrated stylus. The better screen, although an initial advantage, could be a disadvantage when it comes to performance and battery life. And the stylus ? Well, if you're into that, you can always buy one for the Asus. There's also the difference in the screens aspect ratio (3:2 v 16:), but that's very subjective. The Pro doesn't have a back-lit keyloard, and (I'm told) has a more cramped keyboard layout due to its size (dictated by the 3:2 aspect ratio of the screen). So, in my eyes, The Asus comes out on top.Would I recommend the Asus Chromebook Flip C302 to other people ?Without a doubt.It's brilliant as a Chromebook, and great as a Tablet replacement. I love it !If you've been tempted by it, then I'm sure you'll be more than happy with it.

Big_dataset_1143,Big_dataset,"I'm a big fan of chromebooks in general and I really thought this was a great machine. This review is written for those who are looking for chromebooks and won't discuss the differences between a full windows / apple  product. Except for one fatal flaw....I also won't discuss android app support, which worked but was quite buggy...given that it is a beta channel, I was fine with that level of implementation.TL:DR...loved the laptop, couldn't get a bluetooth mouse to work without lag...had to send it back.The good: Great screen, I didn't mind the 16:9 aspect ration (as compared to chromebook plus/pro) and media consumption is something that I do regularly on my laptop. I particularly liked the coloring of the screen...it had a cast to it, that I found pleasing to the eye. I put it up against an acer r13 and an hp envy 13 (windows 10) machine and it seemed to my eyes the the asus screen was the best (I did not compare it to the chromebook plus/pro which have been reviewed as having great screens.) I thought the build quality was excellent, it felt solid in my hands and the hinge had a great feel for holding the screen in place as well as being able to flip it easily into tent/tablet mode. I was particularly impressed with the keyboard, which was...fantastic. I was blown away by the speed of this chromebook. Page loads were insanely quick. I loved that about this piece of hardware...everything felt like it was moving at the right pace...I never had to wait for things to load or run. It felt very, very agile. Connections were fine, I wouldn't have minded a usb3 port, just for legacy support...Great key travel...I found myself typing about 10-15 wpm faster than I usually do (averaging around 60-65 wpm). It just felt great. The trackpad was okay...in this respect the glass trackpad on the HP envy was clearly better...but - I end up using a mouse most of the time anyway. Which brings me to my three star review and why I ultimately returned this laptop. I mainly interact with the screen through typing and mousing and I could not find a bluetooth mouse that would work correctly. They all connected and worked (I tried a logitech m535 and a teknet bluetooth mouse) but, each mouse (or the bluetooth connection) seemed to go to sleep if not used for about...10-15 seconds. So - every time I didn't use the mouse for just a bit, I would have to wake up the connection...this proved untenable because I would invariably scroll down a webpage to read more and I wouldn't get a response and then I would scroll again and then the connection would be made and the page would react as if I had scrolled 2-3 times (which I had, but nothing had happened) and jump down. I just found this...ultimately not workable. I tried shaking the mouse everytime I wanted to use it to wake it up...but - after a couple of days, I just wasn't going to pay $500 for a machine that didn't work well with a mouse. I bought a usb-c dongle and attached my old non-bluetooth nano connector mouse and it worked fine...but - that just looked janky to me...buying a brand new laptop and every time I wanted to go into tent mode or tablet mode...have to remove the dongle.If but for a bluetooth mouse that worked...I would give this laptop 5 stars easily....

If you are like me and spend 99% of your time on the intenet and never use software then a chromebook is for you.The design and thin and light. Next to my husband's mackbook, the aluminum feel is very similar. I like thay when you close it there seems to be magnet that reforces the closed hinge.There is a mirco sd card slot that I have a 200gb mirco sd card in which gives me more than enough space.The charger is the new usb c and there are ports on both sides if the device. How great is that?The keyboard is backlit which I enjoy every much. I heard on some forums people refer to it as spongy. The butterfly technology is used on these keys so it may be different if you are not used to it.With productivity there is no lag. The M3 holds true to its reputation. It's fast. To boot up from shut down to logged in and ready to use takes all of 30 seconds. Multi tasking is not an issue as this device can handle the many tabs. The device only gets noticeably warm for me with long video playback like over an hour.The camera is not the greatest, but it is functional if you need to use it for video calling. And it even has a little light on it to help the picture qualify.Battery life is pretty good. I can get between 7-9 hours of use depending on what I am doing and the level of brightness. I have a bluetooth mouse though. So when I use that the battery life decreases to about 5-6 hours easy.Some people are upset because there are issues with the plan store. While I can understand your frustration that is more so Google's fault rather than the devic itself. The chromebook works as advertise.Some mentoned issues with the touch screen. Haven't had any.I give this a 4 star rating because the tablet mode is not functional for me and probably wouldn't be for most people. Next to my ipad, this screen in tablet mode is very long feeling. Reading a kindle book i had about 2 pages worth of book on the screen at one time and it was weird. This is not a big deal for me as I did not buy this to double as a tablet, but it is advertised that way and it's not really functional.Having never owned a chromebook before and only having apple devices in my house for the last few years, this was a good purchase that I am impressed with and now stuck on. From my research this is one of if not the best chromebook available for purchase today.

Big_dataset_1147,Big_dataset,"I have owned several chromebooks over the years, but with the new Google Play Store only coming to the new models, I knew it was time to upgrade my i3 equipped Dell 11. After doing a bit of research it was clear that the choice came down to the Asus C302, or the Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro. I decide on the Acer 302 Chromebook for several reasons:1. The new Samsung Plus is powered by a Rockchip processor, which made me highly suspicious that it would perform well, and while the Intel M3 powered Samsung Pro looks really nice, it won't be ready until April.2. I wouldn't use the S-pen so that would be pretty much wasted on me. Tablet mode is for plane trips only.....at least for my particular use.3. While the Samsung Plus/Pro has a higher resolution, the Asus has the nicer screen ratio. I'm just not into 3:2 screens.4. The Asus has a lighted keyboard.....the Sammy doesn't5. The Asus has more HD space (64 gig versus 32 gig on the Sammy).So how does the Asus 302 perform? So far fantastic! The M3 processor is every bit as snappy as the i3 on my Dell 11, with the added bonus of not needing a fan. Both score around 20K on the Octane 2 test.The screen is crisp and bright. The fonts and icons aren't too small like were on the first generation of high rez Chromebooks like the Toshiba 2. Battery life is good at about 10 hours. The swiveling hinge for tablet mode is smooth as silk, and it's really quite an engineering feat for a device in this price range. The keyboard is spacious, and has a nice tactile feel. While the body is aluminum, it feels like they cut corners on the frame, as there is a little more flex in it than I like to see. Micro SD card, dedicated volume buttons, mini stereo plug, power button, and two USB C ports finish off the accouterments on the sides of the device. While I don't play on using it much in tablet mode, I wanted a device that had tablet mode primarily so that I didn't have to store it while taking off and landing on a plane.Regarding Android App access. Currently you've got to put the machine in the beta channel to access the Android Store. Over the years I've spent most of my time in the beta channel......with very few issues. One strange little quirk I will mention is that after placing the machine in the beta channel I did not initially see the store. At the advice of a friend I had to powerwash, then move the device into the developer channel, and then revert it to the beta channel. Only then could I access the store.Running Android apps themselves are a pretty ""meh"" experience. Many of them won't run full screen, and those that do have fonts too small to be useful. My biggest hope was to find a decent Android mail app that I could use offline when on a plane, and there are quite a few that run nicely. Games are hit and miss. Some work, some don't. My feeling right now is that web apps pretty much still work the best with Chromebooks. Android apps are designed for small touchscreens, and Google is going to have to improve it's developer tools to get Android apps to work flawlessly under Chrome. It's definitely a great first attempt, but it has a way to go before it's ready for prime time.As far as a Chromebook device this IS the Chromebook to get in early 2017, and worth every bit of the $499 price tag imho.

Which works out perfectly. I can put the i7 laptop in luggage, then carry-on the chromebook. Now I can easily travel internationally with full computing capacity. Why not use the i7 laptop only? I did for a while, but it's still ~6 lbs with exhaust fans. The chromebook is ~2 lbs without exhaust fans. This intel m3 feels just as snappy as my i7's when browsing google maps or other normal use. The asus c302ca in particular is loaded with all the features you should want. Absolutely recommend this great little machine.

On the one I received, the trackpad is hard to press down and seems to rub against the palm rest casing. The top metal monitor casing seems to be soft and bendable. Mine arrived with the metal screen casing slightly bent, I can easily bend it back, not sure about the durability of this thing in the long term. Screen is good, but not as good as the Samsung Chromebook Plus. A bit heavy as a tablet, and the widescreen is not meant to be a tablet, so I felt I'd go with a 4:3 screen when the Samsung Chromebook Pro comes out. In the end, I returned this unit.

I'm not very techie when it comes to the workings, hardware, etc of a computer.  I disabled all the extensions and even completed a Powerwash as the help center advised.  It still continues to shut down and start up on it's own.  I've printed the return because it's going back.  Part of the problem could be me because I don't know enough about computers, but they should be made for all levels of expertise, including those of us who don't know anything.  I specifically bought this because 95% of our use is on the internet and no antivirus protection is needed.  It sounded clean and simple, exactly what we need.

Big_dataset_1162,Big_dataset,"This is my sixth Chromebook (Samsung Chromebook, Acer C720P, Toshiba Chromebook 2 2014, Asus Chromebook Flip C100 and Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015). The C302 is by far the best one of them all. It combine a great touchscreen, a fast speed and a long battery life in a very tight package.The addition of Android apps (in beta for now) greatly help Chrome OS feel more like a complete OS but without compromising the fast boot time and ease of use that Chromebooks are known for. The 64 Gb of storage is also perfect for Android since those apps are a lot bigger than native Chrome OS apps and the ability to add storage with a microSD is realy practical.The backlit keyboard feel great with good travel and the trackpad work like a charm (although it is a little small, which is understandable considering the relatively small form factor of the computer).All in all, this is the perfect Chromebook for today and it is ready for the full Android experience that will supposedly be available in a few months.

Big_dataset_1165,Big_dataset,"I waited for the Samsung Chromebook Plus but after comparing the two, the Asus C302 is much better for me.Here are my Top 10 Reasons why the Asus C302 is better than the Samsung Chromebook Plus:1) Lighted keyboard2) Larger keyboard for better typing (Samsung's is cutoff on the sides)3) Samsung screen is too tall. Especially for airplane travel and using in my car4) Longer battery life5) Faster processor6) Twice the storage (may be important for downloading apps in the future)7) Stylus is a gimmick. I don't need a built in stylus. I can buy and use another stylus. Don't want to be locked into losing and then having to buy a specific stylus at a higher cost.8) Faster performance with HD screen vs Quad HD. Sure the Quad HD screen is amazing on the Samsung but it also takes a lot of processing power and I find the Asus HD screen to be plenty good.9) Asus one year accidental damage protection comes with it at no extra cost (in most cases depending on how you buy)10) Several minor issues but I prefer the touchpad on the Asus. The Samsung seems to have some current operating issues and freezes (temporary). Also, while I'm not positive, but I believe the Asus is a new model - Samsung from what I have read, built their Chromebook months ago but decided to sit on it waiting for the app store update from Google.I hope that helps anyone who is trying to make a decision. Both machines are excellent and really it comes down to how you will be using it.

Big_dataset_1169,Big_dataset,"Updated: 03/15/2017With the latest updates in the Beta channel Clash of Clans appears to be stable once again.Version 57.0.2987.100 beta (64-bit)Platform 9202.51.0 (Official Build) beta-channel caveARC Version 3794798Firmware Google_Cave.7820.277.0[Updated: 2/18/2017]I purchased this from a 3rd party since it was in-stock and I wouldn't have to wait up to four weeks for amazon to ship it.In general it seems like it's going to be a pretty solid little chromebook. I feel more like I'm using one of those fruit based products than an ASUS, which I think is a good thing.The Play Store is less than ready for use on this model.  It's touted as being available in the stable 56 branch as of this week, but it is not as I'm sitting here looking at the OS version 56.0.2924.87.  I was able to switch to the beta branch and the play store became available.  Unfortunately the main game I was looking forward to playing, Clash of Clans, crashes too often to be usable.  There is a bug report in the Chromium bug tracking list, so hopefully this will be resolved sooner rather than later.That said, many of the other apps seem to work well enough.  I was able to watch Netflix without any unreasonable issues.  I'll provide a list of tested apps as time progresses.  Most other Android Apps I've tested crashed infrequently and generally when closing them.  I've also not found a good way to clear Android App storage (cache) and googling for an answer is a minefield of ""how to clear browser cache"" links, which I don't think is what I'm looking for.My other use is going to be to load Linux and dual boot. This requires you to use Developer Mode and update the RW_LEGACY partition on the Chromebook.  I've successfully booted to Kali Linux at this point and detailed it in a blog (comment for the link if interested).For those that don't know there are a few conditions that will cause you to lose all local data.  Those are* Reverting from BETA or DEV channels back to a more stable version* Enabling Developer Mode for the first time* Clicking the space bar at the OS Verification page while using Developer ModeThere are quite a few stories on the net of people spending a lot of time setting up developer mode only to lend the CB to someone who didn't know about the OS Verification message and hit the space-bar after a reboot, wiping all local changes, including crouton and all other developer preferences.The icing, as can be seen in comments, is that ASUS actually reached out and acknowledged my concerns about the app store.  Rodel did respond in a timely manner and said my questions would be escalated to engineering.  However, I figured out how to get Kali Linux loaded up so any response from ASUS regarding that issue is moot.So, I'm going to leave this at a 4 rating for now while I do other benchmarks.  I was a little concerned when writing the iso image to the SD card that the chromebook became almost completely unresponsive.  I'll post some photos and screenshots as time permits.

Big_dataset_1170,Big_dataset,"I've been using Chromebooks since the early Acer models and am also a long time Android user. To read the news that Android apps would come to the Chromebook starting with the convertible models like the Flip and Acer R11 took me there. The apps support has come a long way since when they first came out I believe. So have the chromebooks. We see more and more devices that offer more memory, storage. Stretching the boundaries but still true to what a chromebook is. To me its a zero wait for update and configuration and app support device that I can lose or have fail and the replacement is easily obtained and used.This chromebook is different though. Its that perfect size and use factor for using as a laptop or flipping to tent or tablet mode. If you want android apps, I am currently on the beta channel but I believe they have moved to stable. If you want something with good battery life, I am getting about 10 to 11 hours on a charge. Traveling on a 5 day vacation means no need to hunt down elusive power strips and I can tether to my android phone or use wifi and also use a VPN solution just to protect myself. The device is not the cheapest nor is it the most expensive. To me, it comes in at the sweet spot of use and affordability.I give it 4 stars because the android apps are simply not done but with the titles i can use and games I can play, its edging to the 5 star area. Realmyst, Simcity Buildit, tower defense game all work well. Productivity apps all work for me like MS Office apps. Its simply a great choice yet unfinished. If you know what a chromebook is and what it can do, I think you will be good with this choice. If you expect a classic laptop this may not be what you want. If you want a tablet replacement this may become that. You may have to hang around for awhile and get use out of it though.

Big_dataset_1174,Big_dataset,"FINAL EDIT - July 10, 2017:We've got Android Nougat on Beta running pretty well now.  Most of my Play Store related gripes are gone.  Now I'm just down to some gripes that are probably here to stay: the Bluetooth on this thing is really fussy (I have a brand new Bluetooth speaker that works flawlessly with every device I own *except* the C-302 - which cannot successfully connect), the non-functional video output (using USB-C video out through an HDMI cable sends just a blank desktop background and no audio, even if I am playing a movie or Youtube visibly on the C302 screen), and that it can't hold a VPN connection without dropping it every 20-30 minutes.This will be my last update unless Play Store goes stable anytime soon.My final verdict - it's somewhat solid as a device now that 6 months of updates and delays are behind us...and it's fun.  However, even after this level of updates - Chrome OS, despite its minimalism, feels pretty half-baked compared to Windows or Mac devices.  Given the quality of Windows laptops near this price range, it's *very* tough to recommend this device unless you LOVE the idea Android apps...EDIT - April 26, 2017I don't think Play Store is coming to this device anytime soon, if at all - removing 1 more start, simply due to all the other Chromebooks out there that support Android apps now that you can buy instead.  As great as the device is hardware-wise, I'm super disappointed at how badly delayed this is.Also, this is the only device in my home that my Chromecast doesn't seem to work well with....and USB-C video out doesn't work at all (it will send the screen's background, but none of the content such as the web browser or video player playing on the C302 shows up on the monitor).  Sigh.**EDIT - March 11, 2017:Sill no Stable access to play store.  Most apps run pretty-OK in Beta - some problems I'm noticing in Beta are that Bluetooth is less than ideal (more problems connecting/holding bluetooth, with devices that my Pixel works perfectly with) and I believe battery life suffers greatly, now that I've been paying attention to it.  I watched a 2 hour movie on a flight yesterday (no wifi, no bluetooth, screen 80% bright), and those 2 hours took the C302 down to about 30% battery (from full).  The stock video player misses audio on a lot of movies, and using the VLC app (android) is super buggy (frequently freezes and shuts down).  It's increasingly disappointing to see the much-hyped Play Access is still nonexistent.  I'm still loving the *idea* of what the C302 is supposed to be, but the execution is feeling more and more of a miss.  What the heck is going on, Asus/Google?EDIT - February 24, 2017:OK...looks like Play Store is back in Beta - I'm running it currently..seems to run fine.It would be great if Google/Asus let their customers know when updates were ready for channels on the device - a notification like on an Android device would be nice.  As it is now, browsing /chromebook on Reddit is about the only resource I seem to have for knowing when there are updates available for each channel.  I'm aware that I can always change channels on my C302, but that involves Powerwashing and starting from scratch each time.  Anyhow...still waiting for a Stable Play Store.**EDIT - February 18, 2017:I am removing a star for the C302 as of the most updates.  Play Store access (as the C302 has received system updates) has progressed from being available in Developer mode only, to working nicely in Beta channel, to being available in Stable channel (and functioning very poorly), back to Beta only, and finally, as of this week - Play Store is no longer available except for in the Developer channel.  Needless to say, Android/Play rollout is being managed very, very poorly.  For the moment, please note - ***this product no longer works with the Google Play store in Stable or Beta*** and there is no communication about what we can expect, or when.  I will update this review when there is further progress - I believe this is a 5 star product but the updates are reducing my confidence in the software.  I have trouble recommending the C302 given that the Samsung Chromebook Plus works just fine with the Play Store.  Original review below.**Some of you will remember the Asus “Transformer” line of Android tablets - pretty respectable tablets with Tegra processors, decent builds, and most importantly - a keyboard dock that was far, far superior to any on-screen keyboard options.  I owned a couple over the years as they progressed.  There were great...sort of.  Sometimes they felt a bit half-baked, but I loved the idea, and the keyboard made a world of difference in what you could do with that tablet.  I remember them fondly.  The Asus C302 is, for me, the dream of that perfect Asus tablet/keyboard combo made real.I’ve had the C302 for about a week and a half.  I want to provide you all with some new information with this review, but first, let’s go over a few of the important basic points:- Good screen.  Bright enough for all uses, and 1080p is perfect - images are sharp, it takes less computing and battery power to push 1080p than a higher-res screen.- Battery life is solid, right around what is claimed - probably 7 to 10 hours depending on variables such as screen brightness and how demanding you’re being with it.- The M3 processor is *plenty* of power for all Chrome, video, and Android requirements.- The keyboard reminds me of Macbooks I’ve used - this is a big plus.  It is backlit.- For almost all things that I do as a casual user, the C302 is 100% as effective my Dell XPS 13 that is powered by a skylake i5.  That is a major compliment to Asus, as the Dell is the best small Windows laptop on the market.  As a matter of fact, I’m posting my XPS on ebay today, actually.  That’s how confident I am in the Asus after 10 days.- Android apps work rather well, even if not perfectly yet.  This is a big win.  I’m still using Chrome for almost all native Google Apps, however, since Chrome tabs/apps simply work better/faster/easier than their Android counterparts.- Build quality.  The C302 is clean and feels solid. No complaints.Let’s talk about some huge perks that aren’t mentioned much…- Portable batteries charge the C302!!!  This is HUGE HUGE HUGE for me.  Since the C302 uses USB-C to charge (both of the 2 ports charge it), you can use a portable battery charger to juice the C302 back up!  Since I carry around an Anker 26000 mAH battery (see attached picture), which will recharge the C302 to full about 3 times, I can have a legitimate 40 hour, ‘off the grid’ usage time!  As someone who loves camping, but likes to be able to read, write, and play games while doing so, this is a major win for me.  Batteries do charge slower than the high-output wall charger (you get a notification the device is charging slowly), but this is still insanely useful.- USB-C charging means you can also use a normal multi-USB wall charger (like you'd use for a phone) with the C302.  This is slower than high output charger that comes with the unit, but it means you can reduce clutter a bit if you only charge overnight.- Several second boot time from a cold start.  As in, count to 5 and that’s probably more time than you need.- Touchscreen is responsive enough for gaming.  I loaded up Super Hexagon - the most fast paced, fast-twitch, instant-reaction-required game known to man, and I was able to play at the same level as I could on Android tablets.- Chrome apps have come a LONG way since I last checked a couple years ago. I ABSOLUTELY imagine Chrome apps picking up drastically in quality and quantity now, since it seems like Chrome OS is really coming into its own this year.  Ironically, Android support may fuel the interest in Chromebooks...that fuels the interest in Chrome apps development...and that lack of apps was the biggest holdback to Chromebooks so far.  Nice.- Holding ALT and pressing the brightness + or - button changes keyboard brightness...all the way down to off.  This is a nice perk to save battery life and for folks who like to read//browse late at night in bed and don’t want the backlighting on.- Chrome OS 56 is right around the corner.  This brings you that stable Android support, and it looks like this also will improve battery life and overall performance even further.- You won’t use tablet mode and ‘tent’ mode much...but still...the screen orients extremely quickly when you flip the C302 upside down or move to hold it vertically.- Fully charges in a bit over an hour.  Wow.  This is now my fastest-charging device. I’m surprised this isn’t mentioned more.  It charges insanely fast.- JSTorrent works nicely for any torrenting needs.  I was worried about losing that ability when swapping to Chrome OS.A couple demerits:- Android support is ONLY IN BETA mode as of February 5, 2017.  Asus really should be a bit more clear about this part - I thought I was going to be able to turn this puppy on and start downloading my library of apps right out of the box.  This was somewhat of a letdown until I figured this out.  Update to the latest version of the beta channel in OS settings, and then you get a little box that says ‘enable play store’ and you can start using Android apps.  I’ve read this is the reason you can’t buy the Samsung Chromebook quite yet...Sammy is waiting for ‘stable’ Chrome OS Android support for their product.  That being said - I have no complaints yet about what I’m experiencing in Beta mode on the C302...the experience feels quite stable to me.- Bezels.  They matter.  That Dell XPS that I’m dropping for the C302?  It has nearly the exact same footprint, despite packing a 13.3 inch screen into the same space that Asus puts a 12.5 inch screen.  I’d love to see the bezel size reduced, shrinking the C302 to help the portability and with the ease of using the device as an actual tablet.- In tablet mode, the screen looks too ‘tall’ to feel natural (see the attached picture).  This screen ratio makes it look great in desktop mode...which I use way more often, so that’s a fair trade I suppose.So, I’ll update if with more details if I have any.  I’ll end the review simply saying I’m very happy overall with my purchase!  Cheers!

Big_dataset_1175,Big_dataset,"I bought this to replace my Dell CB 13 (i3 processor), a machine that I really like. The Asus has the touchscreen, which makes it better for Android apps. I'm getting the same Octane scores on the Asus that I got on the Dell (~20,000), which translates to very smooth performance--no matter what tasks you throw at it. The keyboard is really nice--every bit as good that the excellent keyboard on the Dell 13. The touchpad on the Asus is plastic, so it doesn't feel as nice as the glass touchpad on my Dell, but it works well: taps are registered accurately and multi-touch gestures work fine. The screen is plenty bright, and the sound from the speakers is fine for a laptop (you won't be filling a room with sound). The touchscreen works very well, and Android apps are working right now if you're on the beta channel for Chrome OS. Battery life is good enough to get me through a day at work (expect about 8 hours); this is much less than the Dell, which yields about 11 hours, but the Asus is quite a bit lighter, too. I've enabled developer mode, as well, so I could install Linux, giving access to Libre Office, Gimp, fastboot, adb, and other apps that are not available for Chrome OS or Android. Linux (Ubuntu Trusty) works just fine as a crouton chroot.

Big_dataset_1176,Big_dataset,"9-8-2017:  A couple weeks back the Google Play Store/Android Apps arrived (and have remained) on the Stable Channel, so I would like to change the focus of my review.  The long awaited Core m5 version of the C302CA has arrived for nothing short of a staggering price!  To this I have to say that in no way is the Core m5 version worth the current asking price (649).  I should also add that I was someone who was willing to shell out north of a grand for the original 2013 Chromebook Pixel, and then again for the 2015 Chromebook Pixel LS.  Outside of my Pixel LS, the Core m3 C302 is the machine I use the most, and is has never left me wanting with the exception of the display (relative to the Pixel's).  Yes, the Core m5 will make this machine even faster, but considering that some mostly unnecessary speed is ALL you will be getting for an additional 200 bucks over the m3 I don't think it's worth it.  You still get the same 4GB of RAM as the m3, you still get the same 64GB SSD as the m3, and you still get the same old slightly above average FHD display.  If I really wanted to step up from the Core m3 version of the C302 I'd move to the Core m3 Samsung Chromebook Pro.  Yes, I'd have to sacrifice a back-lit keyboard, and live with a 32GB SSD, but I'd gain a truly beautiful display with a 3:2 aspect ratio that is so much better when using machine in tablet mode (I had a Samsung Plus...gave to my daughter).  I'm sure this rant will catch me some heck from a few people, but when I saw what Asus was offering with the m5 C302 flip I felt I had to give my two cents.  And hey, if you have a load of cash just burning a hole in your pocket and you want to spend it on the next great Chrome OS device, I say wait just a little longer for the arrival of ""Eve"" (the soon to be announced and newest Chromebook Pixel).2-8-2017:  As of this date and the arrival of Chrome OS version 56, the Play Store and Android apps have come to this Asus C302ca on the Stable Channel.  If you pick one of these laptops up you may have to let it run through the update process after you set it up.  Chromebooks usually come with a not so recent version of Chrome OS, but once they're up and running they will download the latest version of the OS and you'll be good to go.  If you want to get to the update ASAP you can simply follow my directions below to where I added the ""NOTE"".2-13-17:  My Flip 2 downloaded an update to the Stable Channel, and when I applied it with the restart I no longer had access to the Play Store or any of my Android apps.  I have posted my issue on several Chromebook/Chrome OS pages/groups and hopefully I will have an answer as to what is going on soon.Original Review:I wasn't going to write a review for this Chromebook, but after reading the lone 1 star review, I felt it necessary to set things straight about how easy it is to get Android apps on this machine right now (2-5-2017).  Unfortunately, the 1 star reviewer was making a very simple and unfortunate mistake in his/her efforts to get the Play Store on his Flip 2, and I tried to help him in the comments on his review.  As far as the machine itself, the Flip 2 is one of the finest Chromebooks I have ever used, and I have used/owned/own more Chromebooks than I can remember.  I personally use a 2015 Pixel LS, an HP Chromebook 13 G1 (Core-M7), and this Chromebook Flip C302CA.If you're willing to wait just a bit longer, and if you don't want to change channels on your Flip, Chrome OS Stable version 56 should be coming out very soon and it should have the Play Store, but if you wan't the Play Store today, and all of those Android apps, here's how you get it.  Chromebooks can run 3 different versions of the Chrome Operating System and those versions are referred to as ""Channels"".  By default, your Chromebook will run on the ""Stable"" channel which is exactly what it's called: Stable.  If you want to be a little ahead of the curve and run a future stable version of Chrome OS you can switch your Chromebook to the ""Beta"" channel.  It isn't as bug free as the stable channel, but I very rarely encounter problems while running on ""Beta"", and I've really enjoyed using Beta with Android apps on my Chromebooks since they first became available.  The last channel is the ""Developer"" channel.  I don't recommend developer since it can be quite problematic at times, but it is an even further look into the future of Chrome OS than the Beta Channel.To get Android apps right now, you need to first change to the Beta Channel, and it's incredibly easy.  You go to the settings by tapping the clock (status area) in the lower right corner of the screen and then tapping the little gear (settings) in the lower left corner of panel that has popped up.  The ""Settings"" panel will open and you next need to click on the blue colored ""About Chrome OS"" link that's at the top of the panel.  This opens the ""About"" panel and here you need to tap on the blue colored ""More Info..."" link that's just below the  ""Check for and Apply Updates"" button.  (NOTE: now that Play Store is on the Stable channel you only need to click the ""Check For and Apply Updates"").  You should now see an expanded version of the ""About"" panel with a ""Channel"" section.  It will show what channel you are on, and there will be a button available that says ""Change Channel"".  Tap the change channel button and select the Beta channel in the new panel that pops up.  Once selected, the machine will download the Beta channel version of Chrome OS.  It shouldn't take all that long (maybe a couple minutes) and when it's done you will be prompted to restart to install the update.  After the restart you should notice a new Play Store shortcut on the shelf (the bar at the bottom of the screen).  It looks like a white briefcase with the Google Play logo on it (and is not to be confused with the Google Play shortcut that is completely different).  Simply tap this shortcut, and the Play Store setup process should begin.  If for some reason you do not see this app you can search for it in the launcher (tap the circle in the lower left side of the shelf).  If it isn't there you may have to go back to the settings and enable the Google Play Store.  Once you're all set up it may take a while before apps you purchased for other devices will show up as being free for you to download, and I also recommend doing a quick restart once you have the Play Store all set up just to kind of reload/refresh everything.  If you want to go back to the Stable Channel once the Play Store is available you need only to do the same procedure again.  However, when you go from Beta to Stable (or Developer to Beta) this change will require a Power Wash which basically sets your machine back to factory.  Before you move to a more stable channel it's important to back up the files in your Downloads folder into your Cloud Drive as they will all be deleted during the PowerWash.  Chrome OS syncs your settings to the cloud, so when you log in after the switch things should basically go back to how you had them minus any features not available in the more stable version of Chrome OS.I hope this review is a help to people, and I also hope that it isn't needed for much longer and that we get the Play Store on the Stable Channel.  This Flip 2 really is a fantastic Chromebook, and the ability to run Android apps only makes it better!  Please feel free to comment with any and all questions you may have, and I'll be happy to answer.

Big_dataset_1178,Big_dataset,"Screen is excellent, but on the smaller side (12.5"", about on par with Macbook Core M). Build quality is excellent. Even though the processor is only M3, speed is quite good, and you have the benefit of it being fanless. I like the fact that this can be turned into a tablet, however, not sure how practical that is since the keys don't retract.The trackpad is excellent.Battery life appears to be excellent -- didn't track the numbers, but watching the gauge over days of use, never had concern about drainage. Seemed to hold its charge well over a long period of use.The fit and finish of the aluminum body, and the quality and stability of the hinges, are impressive at this price point, considering they appear to be very close to the build quality of the core M processor Apple Macbooks.In terms of the keyboard, that's one area that I wasn't overly-impressed with. Because the bulk of key design is hidden below the surface, it's hard to comment on the actual quality. I previously used an HP Chromebook 14, a wholly-different animal, but a beast in terms of durability except for the really bad keyboard, so I'm leery about whether other Chromebooks cut corners in this regard. No evidence that this is the case here, but the keyboard didn't jump out at me as particularly wonderful in contrast with everything else about the  build which is super-impressive. The finish on the keys has a slightly pebbled texture, probably to minimize finger slippage. It's a matter of personal taste, but I am not a fan of the texture.

Had been waiting since October for the Samsung Chromebook Pro release to replace my 10"" Flip and 13.3"" Acer R13 but this Asus C302CA (AKA Flip 2.0) chromebook is clearly the winner for me.  Has everything I was looking for, such as touch screen capability, tablet convertible, small bezel, lightweight and small footprint, *backlit* keyboard, not one but two **USB-C** ports, Octane 2.0 score of approximately 25,000, HD display resolution, and responsive trackpad.  Android apps run pretty well on this chromebook also.  If I had to find things to improve, I would shrink the bezel size even more, and push out the screen size to 13.3"" while only slightly increasing the footprint size of the chromebook overall.  And 8GB memory wouldn't hurt.  This chromebook has *no* USB 2.0/3.0 ports but I don't see this as a negative when you have two USB-C ports available.

Big_dataset_1182,Big_dataset,"I just wanted to echo the positive reviews.  This is a spectacular Chromebook.  I've had an Acer 720 since Jan 2014 (and have been happily Windowsless since that time).  Even though I've found many of the newer models sexier, I was never able to find an upgrade that was as speedy and portable as the 720.  However, this new Asus 302CA is what I've always wanted out of a Chromebook, and it is an amazing step up from the Acer.  It's faster, the screen is MUCH nicer, and it has twice the memory and four times the drive space.  As a professor, I've found my Chromebook to be an indispensable tool in the classroom, at home, and at the coffeeshop, and because the hardware of this Asus is so fantastic, this computer will likely serve me just as long (if not longer) than my Acer 720 (which is still going, it's worth noting).

Big_dataset_1183,Big_dataset,"The only con so far is that there is a hairline crack on the corner from who knows what, could have been that way when it arrived. On to the real review. I wish the body was more sturdy and didn't flex like it does, that might be the cause too.This thing is blazing fast and has tons of storage, more than you ever need on a factory chromebook that won't have a Linux dual boot or crouton chrome. I have tried both on it so far and the better of the two at this point is dual booting via chrx to Gallium OS which is modified Ubuntu with the chromebook in mind. There are some bugs they are working on for this laptop but should see lots of attention as more people use it on the beta 2.1 build and submit bugs.I think if I didn't have a need for the backlit keyboard I might have bought the Samsung out of brand loyalty but honestly the keyboard on that one is compressed and seems awkward.Having a backlit keyboard these days is a must and this keyboard has it and the keys feel amazing. My favorite laptop keyboard for sure.I wish the track pad was glass based on the 500 price tag but I can live without I guess.I have heard some mention a noise that it makes in a quiet room but I haven't heard anything yet after almost a month.The screen is crisp and bright, I love it and in my opinion, I like the screen resolution it comes with from the factory and have not set it to the 1920 by 1080 res because it seems too small.

Big_dataset_1187,Big_dataset,"A while back, I sold my Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet due to getting one of the new Samsung phones with VR.  I figured with VR available with my phone for watching movies and whatnot why bother having a tablet anymore?  Eventually though the setup with VR became an annoying thing to go through when I just wanted to watch a 20 minute show and the phone by itself just didn't feel adequate.  So, I started looking for another tablet.  I wanted something with 2 in 1 capability though.  Laptop when I needed it, tablet for most of the time.  I couldn't really find anything that fit the bill for me.  Pure tablets with bluetooth or attachable keyboards were either too expensive for what I felt you got or too cheap and not enough oomph performance wise.Chromebooks seemed like an interesting thing, especially when I found out Google Play was coming.  I tried an Acer Chromebook 14 ($299) and it was alright, but no touchscreen was too much of a dealbreaker for me and the performance wasn't great.  Ended up sending it back.  Then I tried the newer Acer Chromebook 13.3 ($399) with the touchscreen and Google Play on beta.  The touchscreen however just had too many issues with not registering consistently in tablet mode, it was a bit too bulky and again performance was so-so.  I ended up sending that one back too.  Both of the Chromebooks I tried also had multiple dead pixel issues.  I kind of gave up on finding what I wanted for a bit and figured I'd just wait for something better to come along.Well it didn't take long!  Once I saw that this and the Samsung Chromebook Pro line were coming I started researching again.  Eventually decided I'd give this ASUS a shot (but expected I'd probably end up going with the Samsung, their products have personally never disappointed me).  I didn't make it that far.  I've been using this laptop for about 3 weeks now and it has been fantastic.  The trackpad and backlit keyboard are great.  I have owned many laptops over the years and I can't say I've ever had a better experience on either front.  Chrome's trackpad shortcuts are a big reason why.  Normally I just connect a mouse and forget about trackpads, but I feel no need to do that with this laptop.  The backlight on the keyboard is battery friendly with several variable lighting options (use the Alt + Screen Brighten/Dim key to adjust).The full HD display is perfect for me.  At the end of the day I'll take better battery life over a slightly sharper screen.  This is especially true with Chromebooks as from what I understand Chrome OS and higher def screens don't really play well together.  Honestly even at 1080p when using this in tablet mode I sometimes have to tap a couple times while navigating because the targets are so small.  It would be great if they could add the magnifying feature from Android (where you click on something and if it isn't sure what you meant it will enlarge the area so you can more easily tap what you want).  Colors, viewing angles, etc.. no complaints here.  Battery life is as expected.  Maybe not quite as good as advertised but it rarely is.  It isn't far off.Connectivity is solid.  Two USB-C ports futureproofs the device a good bit.  USB-C is the next standard and soon pretty much all of your accessories will be using it, and I personally hate and always lose dongles.  You've also got micro SD for extra storage.Performance is buttery.  Seamless transition from laptop to tablet mode, ~21k Octane score.  Far and away better than the other 2 Chromebooks I test drove.  No doubt the Intel Core M processor is a huge help here.The bulk is admittedly still a little much for a pure tablet user but I mean it's hard to expect this area to be perfect when you're going from strictly tablet to a 2 in 1.  Having the keyboard and trackpad in the back is still a very strange feeling but not something I can't get used to.Besides, the build quality makes the bulk WORTH IT!  This thing is gorgeous.  Solid metal and the hinges feel extremely sturdy.  It's very sleek and could easily be mistaken for a high end laptop if not for the Chrome badging.  The somewhat odd 12.5 inch size is spot on for me.  Just large enough that when you're using as a laptop you don't feel cramped or limited but just small enough that using it as a tablet doesn't feel totally ridiculous.About the only con I can think of is the price.  At 500 bucks you're pushing into a price range where many solid traditional laptop options are available.  It wasn't a huge deal for me.  I spent about the same amount on my last tablet and as far as I was concerned that's what I was purchasing  a replacement for.With the addition of Android apps on Chrome, the Chrome OS provides the perfect level of functionality now in my opinion for all but power users.  It loads lightning fast (~7 seconds cold boot, instant wake up), shuts down practically immediately and is extremely user friendly.  No worrying about updates, drivers or Antivirus.  It just works.  And, if you're feeling a little adventurous, it isn't hard to install Linux on a Chromebook for an actual full fledged laptop experience.  This device in particular is a great candidate for that since it packs more hardware capability with the Intel Core M than most other Chromebooks out there.  You also get double the storage of most Chromebooks (64 gb vs 32).Overall through 3 weeks I can't say enough good things about this Chromebook.  I really feel ASUS has hit a home run here and hopefully I won't run into any unforeseen issues now that I've touted its amazing-ness.  Give it a try!

Very impressed!Chrome OS 56 just released, so you get the Android Google Play Store without having to use developer mode.  Yeah!By the way, if you are worried about not having Windows access, just download the Microsoft Remote Desktop app from the Android store.  Works great.  I can now control my windows 10 laptop via touch (its not a touch screen).  It can sit in the corner and collect dust now, since I am done waiting for windows....Update March 3, 2017 - Apparently Google decided to disable the Google App Store with no warning.  One day it just disappeared.  At first I thought it was just me.  Powerwash, no luck.  So, I decided to try the dev channel.  That did work, but there were so many bugs it was unusable.  When I went back to stable, no app store.  Without the app store, it is just a chrome browser.  One can get that on any computer!Update March 21, 2017 - OK, so I have been able to get the play store back.  I had to set it to the Beta Channel, and then WAIT a few days for it to decide to update.  Not sure why the wait.  Anyway, after that, you can go into settings and turn on the play store.  So far, so good.  I'll make it a 5 star when (if?) Google releases the play store on the stable channel.Update January 2018 - Back to 5 stars.

Big_dataset_1189,Big_dataset,"Purchased mine at Newegg, but it's the exact one listed here.I previously had the Acer Chromebook R13 and while it was great, this was definitely worth the extra $70 (I had the $429 64GB R13)! I do a lot of screen captures of streams or make tutorials for friends to share on Drive when they need visual help, and during recording, the R13 was fine with no lag. Playing back recording, it was really choppy and not good. I wholly suspect it was the ARM based processor that while fine for everything else, for recording 1080p streams or tutorials, was not good at all for it. Even my Acer 14 with a Celeron chip that benches lower in Octane performed those tasks better. So I got this one with the Core m3 6Y30 chip, and it FLIES through EVERYTHING I throw at it. Screen recording works flawlessly, it streams Youtube 1080p60 with zero dropped frames (Can play 1440p content with maybe a few dropped frames out of a few thousand; tested that popular 4K video from Costa Rica) and loads graphic intensive websites almost as quick as my i7 desktop build. Backlit keyboard, while not the selling point for me is actually really great to have; I believe this is the cheapest Chromebook with a backlit keyboard, and even both models of the Samsung Chromebook Plus and Pro (Pro being $50 more with only 32GB of storage) don't have backlit keys. The brightness on this is great at a peak 300 nits. I typically use it at 4-5 levels below max and it is very comfortable to use indoors. Battery life hovers around 8 hours, maybe less if I have a stream up and recording, but for most users checking e-mail or anything online should get that 8 no problem. Octane scores regularly above 20,000 even with extensions on. Wifi is almost as fast as my desktop PC in Speedtests and that's hardwired with a Cat6 cable direct into modem. And as of today (2/8), Chrome OS 56 launched in the Stable channel which for this Chromebook brings ANDROID APPS! I was running it in 56 Beta since I got it and had Android apps, but it had random restarts a lot in that channel. Now that it's in stable, I know it won't have random restarts, and they even improved the full screen feature for apps so this will be a great tweak and update to something that was great already. If you're looking for a very well built 2-in-1 laptop for any occasion and mostly work in the browser or can find substitutes with Android apps to get work or fun done, I see ZERO reason to look elsewhere than this Chromebook. Do keep in mind that out of the box this comes at a lower resolution; 1536 x 864. Just go to the settings icon, Display settigns and set it to the best resolution of 1920 x 1080. Chrome OS scales text well to keep sharpness and clarity, but you can scale text bigger if 1080p on this 12.5"" screen is too small.

Big_dataset_1191,Big_dataset,">> Should I Get a Chromebook?A Chromebook is basically an inexpensive alternative to a Mac. The Apple operating system and the Chromebook operating system share the same ancestor, and for 90% of users a Chromebook is more than adequate. A lot of the issues facing early Chromebooks - lack of storage, lack of memory, and underpowered CPUs - have been solved. Also, online apps are more numerous and more robust than ever before, which means you -probably- won't feel like you're missing any functionality. And now Android apps are available, which really tilts the scales in favor of the Chromebook, in my opinion.>> OK, So Should I Get This Chromebook?Short answer, yes. I only have experience with two Chromebooks, this ASUS and the Acer R11. The ASUS is more powerful, has the perfect sized screen, and has a much better touchpad. The Acer R11 did give me less trouble upfront, and it is less expensive. However, this ASUS is still a good value for the money, especially if you look at it as a viable alternative to a Mac.

Big_dataset_1193,Big_dataset,"Chromebooks these days are trying to tout themselves as an all-purpose computer. They started off with being for light use but with some introduction to offline capabilities and now the Google Play Store, there's little these Chromebooks can't do, right? Some Chromebooks even advertise themselves to be business friendly.I work at an enterprise software company and have a very technical position, but I'm not a developer per-se. I need access to Webex/GoToMeeting/Skype Meeting, VMWare, Hyper-V, Remote Desktop, RemoteApp, IE (for legacy apps), Notepad++, 7zip, Adobe Professional, Palo Alto VPN, Camtasia Recorder, and others. Most of this stuff I use on a day to day basis. So could I use this Asus Chromebook instead of my Lenovo PC I got from work? Not really, but I can use them together.There are some apps that I can't use on this Chromebook, such as RemoteApp, VMWare, Hyper-V, and VPN and Camtasia. The others I can find some online version that will do just fine. The workaround is to use TeamViewer or Chrome Remote Desktop to RDP into my Lenovo and use the apps that I need. It's a janky solution but I think it's one that works. I'm sacrificing convenience for portability and battery life.Having access to the Play store is a big plus because I can still access MS OneDrive, Word/Excel/PowerPoint/OneNote, Skype for Business, and more. The one annoyance is that Office 365 doesn't provide a seamless way to save file offline and sync up when you're online. OneDrive does provide this functionality, but it only opens the files on the MS Office app installed. The problem is that if I save a file for offline access in OneDrive, when I open that word doc using the native Word app, it opens it in read-only format. If I want to make changes and save those changes, I need to save a copy, make the changes and then upload the new copy to OneDrive. The alternative is to make sure I open my file in Office 365 before I go online so that I can work with it offline. This is kind of a pain and I'm hoping it gets better in the near future.Regarding the Chromebook itself:-The keyboard is great and has a nice gentle/quiet click to it.-The keys themselves don't travel that much which I prefer.-The trackpad, while a little on the small size, has a nice glass smooth finish and it works reliable well.-The screen size is an awkward 16:9 and provides a 1920x1080 resolution (although the default is set to 1536x864). Not great when looking at websites or working on word documents, but it gets you by. Would've prefer a 3:2 ratio instead.-The touchscreen works great and is very responsive. Most of the time I forget that its there until I remember and use it for another 5-10 minutes before I forget again. I don't usually use this in tablet mode since that's not the reason for my purchase, but I'm sure it'll perform admirably.-The build quality is great but not necessarily impressive. While it is an aluminum body, something about it just feels a little cheap. Maybe because it doesn't seem to have any heft to it or because it feels like a plastic/aluminum hybrid. I honestly can't put my finger on it but it doesn't really scream out premium to me.-The battery is a respectable 8 solid hours even when I have webex, 20+ tabs, word, excel, powerpoint, skype for business, onenote, and 5 other apps running and screen brightness at 75%.-Performance wise, the Chromebook does a great job at managing the RAM to the apps that need it. I'm usually peaked with RAM (~95%) which is good because it's better used than not used. I haven't felt any noticeable lag as I'm switching applications or what not. Some apps have crashed on me, but I'm guessing that's because I'm on the beta channel to have access to the Play store and not all the quirks have been figured out.-The Play Store, well it's the play store. If you're familiar with Android, then you've got access to the same stuff here. It does install the ""tablet"" version of the app which is nice, but they don't really have any ""chromebook"" versions yet. Tablet works just fine though.-Regarding the ports, 2 USB Type-C can be limiting but I bought the Dell adapter to connect regular USB, VGA, HDMI and Ethernet. I hooked up a bluetooth mouse that works fairly well and inserted an extra 64GB Micro-SD card for storage. Still can't figure out how to install apps on the SD card though.-Chrome OS is pretty nice and since I'm a big Android fan, it feels more or less like home. I did install Chrome OS (Chromium) on a bootable USB drive and used it on my Lenovo PC before making the purchase so I could test the waters so to speak. There are some limitations with Chromium but it's enough to get my feet wet.Ahh this is turning out to be a longer review than I thought. To summarize, if you're looking at this to use for both personal and business and got some apps that you know for sure won't work on Chromebooks, there is hope with RDP/TeamViewer. For 99% of the people looking at Chromebooks right now for personal use, this Asus is probably the best choice in the market (over the HP 13, Acer 14, and Dell Chromebook). Jury's still out on the Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro.

People have been saying this for years, but the fact that high quality build devices at moderate prices are finally starting to come onto the market and the pending introduction of Android app support means the gap between Chrome OS devices and ""real' computers for most users is closing rapidly.I have long wanted a premium Chromebook, but couldn't justify the price of a Pixel. @ $500 I think the Asus c302 is fairly priced. You are getting a high performance, high build quality device (screen, keyboard, processor, battery) in a thin and light package. If the C302 performs as well as my prior Chromebooks for 2-3 year of daily use, $500 is a bargain.For those holding out for the Samsung Pro, unless you plan on using the Chromebook in tablet mode (where 3:2 screen is optimal) often or just really like 3:2 screens and stylus I think the you'll be more than satisfied with the Asus C302. For me, the back lit keyboard and additional storage for a lower list price than the Samsung Pro sold me on the Asus. So far I'm extremely impressed.

Big_dataset_1198,Big_dataset,"I've been using this new laptop for a few hours now and I will tell you that I love it more than my Toshiba Chromebook II.  I will say it has everything that the Toshiba has and more.  The sound level and quality is practically the same, which is great because the Toshiba has great sound.  The follow is what I believe is where the ASUS is better:- It has a touch screen and will load and play Android applications.  I have used the Kindle app and it works very nicely.  Note: you need to use the beta channel to use Google Play apps.- There is no fan noise or heat from the bottom, which is great.- It is slightly smaller, but it is a little bit lighter.  Just the right size though.- It has type USB-C connectors.  This is much better, thanks.- The keyboard and trackpad is better and feels very nice.  I love it.- ASUS put additional audio volume and power controls on the side.  Not sure why they did this.  I don't believe I'll use them much.  I like the keyboard controls better.But what really sold me on the ASUS C302 was the Illuminated keyboard.  It is difficult, for some reason, to find a good quality Chromebook with an illuminated keyboard.  My old Toshiba has it and so does the ASUS C302.  I will not buy a laptop without an illuminated keyboard, because I hate trying to find the correct keys in dark conditions.  I am not a typist.

Big_dataset_1201,Big_dataset,"So im on a budget these days and I needed a laptop asap on a budget.  I also don’t want something that looks like a toy my kid uses.  So rather than buy a low end windows laptop from dell or acer I decided to go through and pick up a C302 from ASUS.  This is my first ASUS product and I have to say my expectations were super low.  Im used to the more established brands like Dell and HP but after having this for a bit I am really happy I went with ASUS.  The C302 is so crazy.  I found some videos about how to get android apps on the chromebook and I couldn’t believe it.  I had to go into beta mode or something like that and I was able to sync all of my phone apps to the laptop.  My kid also loves it because all the games that are on my phone they she plays with can be found on my chromebook.  She even dropped it on my hard wood floor and it worked fine (a small dent but not really noticeable).  It is a little strange not having a typical operating system but I don’t really use a lot of programs so its actually kind of nice.  I don’t have to keep upgrading and paying Microsoft for operating systems and its half the price of a mac.  BIG WIN for the ASUS C302.

Big_dataset_1202,Big_dataset,"I got this to replace my aging ASUS C300. I'm impressed. The aluminum chassis is a nice upgrade. FAST zippy processor and a BEAUTIFUL display. The backlit keyboard is wonderfully laid out, and the speakers get nice and loud without distorting. I got 3+ years out of my last ASUS. I expect I can get much more out of this one.Edit 1/22/17. I finally found a travel case I like. The 13"" Thule Gauntlet 3.0 case has about 1/4th of an inch of wiggle room on each side but it also accommodates my documents without them getting damaged. I'll use this case until some come out specifically designed for the Asus C302a.

Big_dataset_1203,Big_dataset,"Google and Asus have taken Chromebook build quality and performance to new levels. I cannot understate how fantastic this computer is. Just a year or two ago, if you wanted to spend less than $500 you had to deal cheap plastics, bad screens, and pokey Celeron processors. Now you're getting a full aluminum build, laminated Full HD display, and a nice Intel Core m3 processor. It's been said a million times that ChromeOS is well optimized, but it is worth repeating. This thing is a rocket ship.While the touchscreen is great for Android apps, the trackpad is still your primary input device. So it better be good. And wow, did Asus deliver. The trackpad is nearly as good as Apple's and even better that Microsoft's Precision Touchpads. It never misses a beat.Speaking of Android apps... the value of these Chromebooks has skyrocketed since Google has introduced Android app compatibility. You can install Microsoft Office apps, games, and all kinds of fantastic utilities. And a lot of them work offline! It's not perfect, but you can clearly see Google is working hard to make ChromeOS the only OS you need.Battery life. This is something that Chromebooks have had figured out for a while now. When you close the lid, you can be sure that your battery isn't going to discharge. You're going to get 8-10 hours of usage depending on what you're doing and it's always going to be 8-10 hours. I love that.Screen (Dat Screen!). You're going to be looking at this screen all day and let me tell you, you're going to love it. It's bright, it's sharp, it has great viewing angles, and it has no gap to cause glare. I'd say my only complaint is that it isn't 3:2 or 16:10, but otherwise it's practically perfect.I'm not going to give up my Surface Book or Mac just yet, but you can be sure that this laptop that travels with me everywhere. As long as you don't have really quirky application requirements or need to edit video, the Asus C302CA can serve as your primary computer. It's that good. Go ahead, click buy it now.---Update: 01/24/16 - I wanted to add some notes about the keyboard.The keyboard deck is very firm! It's obvious they paid special attention to this Chromebook, as it is more refined than their Windows laptop offerings in this range. You'll be able to type long documents just as well as you would on a $1500 computer. The keys themselves feel a bit cheap, but they respond well and there is no flex.While I am in love with the keyboard and its backlight, it can be a bit blinding in a dark room and I haven't found a way to adjust the brightness. Overall, this touch-typist is very pleased and I still recommend this Chromebook highly!

Big_dataset_1204,Big_dataset,"My first Chromebook was my Acer C720P back in early 2014.  It was an excellent machine for the money and it also got me spoiled with its touch screen.  I was looking to upgrade and decided to go with the Acer R13.  I was had become partial to Acer and also wanted another Chromebook with a touch screen.  I was incredibly disappointed in the performance of the R13.  It was slow to render web pages and the scrolling wasn't smooth at all.  It felt slower than my almost 3 year old C720P.  I ran Octane 2.0 benchmark and it confirmed my suspicions.  The new R13 scored just under 10,000.  My old C720P scored 13,000.  I couldn't stand the noticeable drop in performance, so I returned it after less than a week.This made me realize that ARM processors are not ready for desktop-class browsing.I saw this C302 was announced at CES and was immediately drawn to it since it has the Intel Core m3 processor.  I ordered it as soon as it was available online.  Let me tell you, this thing is SNAPPY.  Everything you do happens quickly.  Web pages render quickly and scroll very smoothly.  It's night and day when compared to the R13.  It's Octane score is just under 23,000.  Huge difference.Even though it has a larger screen than my old C720P, it doesn't feel more difficult to handle.  It's actually thinner than the C720P and seems to be lighter as well.  The build quality is nice and the hinge is sturdy.  You'd never think it was a 360-degree hinge if you didn't flip it all the way around.  The keyboard also feels nice and the backlighting is great.  I use my Chromebook a lot in the dark and it's a real treat.  I'll never have another Chromebook without this feature.Android Apps are available if you switch over the the Beta channel in settings.  I got several random reboots when I first ran Android apps on the beta channel.  I've decided to power wash and run the beta channel without Android apps enabled for awhile.  Hopefully it was a fluke and maybe I'll give them a try a bit later.  Android apps should make their way to stable channel in a few months.UPDATE 1/14/17: I re-enabled the Play Store in the beta channel and the Chromebook has been flawless.  Apps like Microsoft Word, Excel, etc run wonderfully.  The Android Calendar app also works so much better than the Chrome calendar.  I learned that it's important to pick your battles and decide which Android apps can truly work better than their Chrome counterparts.  For instance, the Android YouTube app doesn't work well at all because it's very inconvenient to get videos into full-screen mode.  Another example is the Android Google Maps app.  It runs very well, but isn't nearly as full-featured as the Chrome version of Maps.  Android Hangouts also doesn't work as well as the Chrome Hangouts App.UPDATE 2/21/17: The Google Play Store became standard in the Stable channel a few weeks ago.  Now you can enjoy Android apps straight out of the box without switching channels.  I do still keep mine in Beta channel because I enjoy receiving updates a bit early and the Chromebook remains reliable with no bugs that I can observe.UPDATE 8/19/17: Just wanted to mention that this Chromebook DOES support downloading the full Microsoft Office apps from the Play Store.  I currently have Word, Powerpoint, and Excel installed.I'm not going to bore you with specs because anyone who shops online can compare specs.  What I'll say is that there is only one other Chromebook providing this level of performance at this price range.  It's the Samsung Chromebook Pro (not the Chromebook Plus, which has an ARM processor like the Acer R13).  While the Chromebook Pro does have a nice high-resolution 3:2 screen and the S-Pen (which is truly a gimmick anyway), it has half the storage, shorter battery life, and no backlit keyboard.  It's also $50 more expensive than this Asus.In my opinion, this is the one to beat.  This is among the best.

Big_dataset_1205,Big_dataset,"First off I am usually not into chrome products and this is actually my first ASUS product so I was a little skeptical going into this whole thing but I was able to pick one up and I am really impressed.  Usually chromebooks are not my cup of tea.  They are not very good looking, they look more like toys and the specs are really bad.  I am currently a mac user and I wanted to get a spare laptop to leave in the living room that I can use while I watch tv.  It didn’t need to do anything more than just be online.  Well this thing does that and more.  Because I can sync all my google docs and apps with my smartphone I can kinda do anything with this.  I was able to get my games and Netflix and also have all my google docs there.  It also flips so if I get really lazy I can use it as a tablet and just scroll through ESPN while I watch sports.  I cant really comment on the battery life because its pretty much plugged in all the time, but I am sure its fine there.  Great product so far.  Love it.

Big_dataset_1206,Big_dataset,"Incredibly functional, versatile, easy-to-use and well built device. Worth every penny. More recently I installed Linux via Crouton which works amazingly well and is very easy to set up. As storage expansion under Linux I use the micro SD cared slot with a 256GB card to which I sync my entire Dropbox and Google Drive (latter via Insync app). Via Android I can now also use the MS Office 365 product line.

Big_dataset_1207,Big_dataset,"Got it a few days ago.The good: nice feel, very fast and reliable in term of battery life. The screen is on par with Apple's LCDs from 2015 I guess. Very comfortable keyboard and responsive touchpad. Light, no fans.The bad: quality (mine came with noticible dents on the lid of the screen and the on/off button print is washed out like it's several years in use. You also can hear some noise from under the screen when you grab the laptop in portrait tablet mode.Overall it's a good machine. Probably it's better to hold off for some time until Asus resolve issues with the quality control. As I see different people report different problems or it was just bad luck for me.

Big_dataset_1208,Big_dataset,"I ordered this Chromebook so I could run Android apps on a laptop.  This Chromebook is advertised as ""Google Play Store/Android app ready"", but the Google Play store app is not preinstalled out of the box.  I tried to install Google Play, but it wasn't available in the Web Store.  So I tried installing the latest updates and rebooted.  Now the Play Store was available in the Web store and I installed it.  I tried installing my 3 favorite Android apps Angry Birds, Skype and the Firefox Browser.  None of these installed.  Instead, I got a message saying "" * will be installed on your device soon.""  That's the same message I got trying to install Android apps on my old Samsung 2012 Chromebook several months ago in developers mode.  What does ""soon"" mean anyway?  I tried installing the Android apps while in the Developer's Channel, but they still didn't work.  This Chromebook is NOT Android app ready, and I'm returning it.  If this laptop really was Google Play Ready, I would give it 5 stars.  But it doesn't give me $500 of added functionality over my old Samsung 2012 Chromebook.

Big_dataset_1209,Big_dataset,"The ASUS C302CA lives up to the hype. This Chromebook looks and feels great, performs even better and will soon support Google Play apps. The aluminum construction is every bit as nice as my 12"" Macbook, the keyboard is excellent and has better travel/feedback than recent Apple keyboards and the trackpad is the best I've used on any ASUS portable. You simply can't argue with ChromeOS on an Intel M3. The 1080p screen is bright and has decent viewing angles, the hinge is smooth and solid enough to not shake when typing on your lap. It's the best non-Apple laptop I've used in years and it's as good as the best Dell ultrabooks for fit and finish, at half the price.

Big_dataset_1210,Big_dataset,"Fantastic. Had the R13, which I feel is another fine device at less than 20% of the price. The device is significant, as many have already said, in its presence (e.g., weight, feel, resolution, response, solidity, etc.). I have heard other wonder at the tablet mode for its dimensions, I can say I read ebooks on it daily in this mode. Interestingly, one gets VERY used to the touchscreen so much so that the trackpad becomes nearly obsolete. The speakers are good, the side-mounted position was a good choice. I came from the HP 14 Chromebook before owning the R13 for a month or so, and I can say that Google Play (apps) changes the whole use-case scenario (in so many ways) for Chromebooks.

Big_dataset_1212,Big_dataset,"The very first Chromebook I ever owned was the first Samsung Chromebook. My mom bought it to do schoolwork, found out that it didn't have Office, and then put it in her closet where it lied for two years. She noticed that she still had it, then started talking to me about how useless it was. I had already been using Google Docs for school at this point, so she decided to give it to me in case I could find any utility in it. For 3 years, I used that thing for everything from reading comics to writing school papers. However, it's began to truly show its age lately, so I began researching what Chromebook to buy next. I really wanted a Dell 13, but Dell isn't interested in stocking it any more, so I decided to buy this Chromebook, the Asus Flip C302. It has made all the difference.---DESIGN---  Much like my old Samsung Chromebook, the Asus Flip C302 (Which will be referred to as the C302 for the rest of this review) takes heavy inspiration from Apple laptops. For a laugh, go to the Asus website and see the product page for the C302. You would have to look at the URL bar twice to make sure you didn't accidentally end up on the product page for a Macbook Pro on Apple's website. The Samsung Chromebook tried to emulate the Macbook Air- the C302 tries to emulate the Macbook Pro. It uses an all-aluminum unibody design that's just gorgeous. My school issues Chromebooks to students, so when I brought the C302 in for the first time, the first comment I got from a classmate was ""That is *not* a Chromebook."" Without the Chrome logo, the C302 would look like a high-end Windows ultrabook. The Core M3 processor allows the C302 to be fanless, as well, adding to the sleek design. I think that the bezels are a smidge thick, but that actually makes perfect sense. The C302 is a convertible laptop with a 360 degree hinge, and it has a touchscreen. The laptop is usually quick to switch to tablet mode when appropriate, but sometimes takes a few seconds to do so. I don't use the C302 as a tablet, but I have used it in ""tent mode"" to watch Netflix in bed. It's a real treat.---Screen---  The C302 uses a 1080p IPS touchscreen. By default, the display is scaled to a lower resolution, which is nice because ChromeOS scaled to 1080p makes everything much too small. The display is extremely glossy and reflective, so keep that in mind if you want to use this laptop outdoors or inside buildings with lots of windows or overhead lighting. The touchscreen works well, although its true potential won't be seen until Android apps come to the C302. I didn't use to see the appeal in a laptop having a touchscreen, but I've since seen the light. It's crazy how you don't notice how long it takes to move a mouse across a screen with a touchpad when you can just tap on whatever you want instead. It's a real timesaver, honestly.---Keyboard---  The C302 has a pretty good keyboard- not the best in the world, but a solid 8/10. In lieu of a power button on the top right, the C302 has a lock button which behaves similarly to the power button. The lock button cannot, however, turn off the Chromebook. More on that later. When the laptop is in tablet mode, tent mode, or whatever, pressing the keys doesn't do anything.---Trackpad---  The trackpad is a mixed bag on the C302. My use experience has been riddled with lag and jitteriness, although using the touchscreen for a moment sorts everything out. Hopefully a software update fixes this, because when the trackpad is working fine, it's near flawless.---Speakers---  The speakers get plenty loud, but they start to sound pretty bad when turned up a little past half volume. You won't want to turn music all the way up so that Grandma can dance to [Insert Current Trending Song Here] at Thanksgiving, but you might want to turn music about halfway up so that you can listen to music while you cook or something.---Battery Life---  Sometimes, I get up to 11 hours of battery on the C302. 'Nuff said!---Performance---  The Core M3 allows this system to get fast and to stay quiet. Sometimes, under heavy loads, the bottom of the C302 gets warm to the touch, but not to the point of pain. All the while, it provides one of the fastest web browsing experiences that I've ever experienced. If you like having a gajillion tabs open like I do, you may want to wait until a variant with 4GB of RAM is available. However, if you like to limit your tabs to around 10 or so, the 4GB option is plenty. I've slowly been weaning myself off of excessive tab usage while using this Chromebook to keep performance and battery life high.---Software---  The C302 runs ChromeOS. If you don't know what ChromeOS is, imagine if you could only use Google Chrome on your computer. That's what ChromeOS is. Android apps are coming to the C302 soon, and if my time in dev mode is any indication, they're going to run extremely well. In dev mode, I had no problem using apps like Pocket Casts, Google Classroom, Solid Explorer, and Spotify. Chrome Unboxed says that regular mode should be seeing Android apps in just a few short weeks.---Overall---  The Asus C302 is my 2nd Chromebook that I've owned (I have a Dell 11 on loan from my school- it's lame), and it will likely be the last Chromebook I'll ever use- unless Google's Andromeda OS never makes it to laptops. It will take years of bad programming to make this Chromebook as slow as my last one got, and even then it will still probably have a better battery life than my Samsung currently has. The C302 loses a star for two reasons: 1) The scaling at 1080p is horrible- Google needs to fix this ASAP. 2) The touchpad is way too wonky- Asus needs to fix this ASAP. Some customers have also reported that their C302s have a loud whining sound coming from their speakers at all times, but I personally don't have that problem. If you're looking to buy a new high-end Chromebook, this is really the one to get.

Big_dataset_1214,Big_dataset,"This laptop is truly amazing. I spent a ton of time researching Chromebooks for purchase, I mean a ton of time. I probably searched around for the right one for about 3 months. I wanted something that was light, fast and had a great screen. This laptop surpassed all of my expectations. I love this thing so much, I am writing a review which I never do. First review ever.For anyone that doesn't own a Chromebook, just know that it is a completely different operating system so there are a few things that are not compatible with Chrome, that is across the board though, doesn't matter what laptop you buy, it is an OS issue. An example would be, I installed a new router the other day and I couldn't install the gui interface for manageability on my machine, it only works on Windows and Mac. Not a huge deal since there is a basic version that is web based, I can get by with that.My favorite 5 things about this laptop are these:1) It is incredibly fast, I am talking CRAZY FAST! When you click on something it pops up. Of course your internet connection plays a part in the speed as well but with a decent connection, everything is very quick.2) The laptop is a 2 in 1 which is becoming very popular. I actually used to work for Dell so I know quite a bit about laptops. Being able to use it like a tablet and then still be a laptop is very functional. In fact I wouldn't buy a machine without that capability moving forward.3) It is super light. Super portable. For me that is key, I don't like lugging around a huge laptop when I travel.4) It has instant on and instant off. When I say instant I mean you press a button and it turns off immediately. You press another button and it turns on almost as fast. There is like a 2 second Chrome screen that comes up, but this is all pretty much instant. I haven't seen another laptop do this. I have another one that is like 15 seconds, which is still blazing fast but this one wins for sure.5) Screen. The screen is absolutely beautiful. I mean it is stunning. Watching movies, playing games, anything entertainment is awesome. Especially for $499. If this thing ever goes on sale, I will probably buy another one for my son.Alright, I am going to shut up about this thing, I just love it so much. I have had it a couple weeks and can't say enough great things about it. If you buy a Chromebook, buy this one!!
